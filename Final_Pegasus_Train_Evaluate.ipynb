We done Aberdeen about three or four months ago - we smashed up that show over there! Everywhere we go we smash it up!\"\\n', 'The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. \"Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,\" he was once quoted as saying.And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.\"Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,\" he said.During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.Then came Dr Venter\\'s real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work \"any monkey\" could do.The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter\\'s disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world\\'s first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.\"I think they\\'re going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said of the synthetic microbes.\"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\"\\n']\n",

I mean, wow!\"Bandmate Fazer added: \"We thought it\\'s best of us to come down and mingle with everyone and say hello to the cameras. And now we find we\\'ve got four nominations.\"The band have two shots at the best song prize, getting the nod for their Tynchy Stryder collaboration Number One, and single Strong Again.Their album Uncle B will also go up against records by the likes of Beyonce and Kanye West.N-Dubz picked up the best newcomer Mobo in 2007, but female member Tulisa said they wouldn\\'t be too disappointed if they didn\\'t win this time around.\"At the end of the day we\\'re grateful to be where we are in our careers.\"If it don\\'t happen then it don\\'t happen - live to fight another day and keep on making albums and hits for the fans.\"Dappy also revealed they could be performing live several times on the night.The group will be doing Number One and also a possible rendition of the War Child single, I Got Soul.The charity song is a  re-working of The Killers\\' All These Things That I\\'ve Done and is set to feature artists like Chipmunk, Ironik and Pixie Lott.This year\\'s Mobos will be held outside of London for the first time, in Glasgow on 30 September.N-Dubz said they were looking forward to performing for their Scottish fans and boasted about their recent shows north of the border.\"We just done Edinburgh the other day,\" said Dappy.\"We smashed up an N-Dubz show over there. We done Aberdeen about three or four months ago - we smashed up that show over there! Everywhere we go we smash it up!\"\\n', 'The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. \"Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,\" he was once quoted as saying.And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.\"Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,\" he said.During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.Then came Dr Venter\\'s real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work \"any monkey\" could do.The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter\\'s disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world\\'s first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.\"I think they\\'re going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said of the synthetic microbes.\"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\"\\n', 'Australia\\'s foreign minister said these were \"not the actions of a friend\".The UK took similar action in March, after concluding that Israel was responsible for the use of forged UK passports in the plot.The Israeli foreign ministry said Australia\\'s decision was disappointing.Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said it was \"not in line with the importance and the quality of the relationship between our countries\".At least four forged Australian passports were used in the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in January. The originals belonged to Australians living in Israel.The Australian government said a police investigation had left it in no doubt that the Israeli authorities were behind \"the abuse and counterfeiting of the passports\".As a result Foreign Minister Stephen Smith asked Israel to withdraw a diplomat, whom he did not identify\"The decision to ask Israel to remove from Australia one of its officers at the Israeli embassy in Canberra is not something which fills the Australian government with any joy,\" he said.\"On the contrary, the decision was made much more in sorrow than in anger.\"Passports from France, Ireland, Germany and Britain were used in the operation, and in March, the British government expelled an Israeli diplomat from London.The Israeli government has said there is no proof that it was behind the killing, although Dubai officials have said they are 99.9% sure that agents from Mossad were responsible.\\n', 'For 70 years, my father has lived with the shame of what happened to his ship, HMS Hebe, in June 1940.During the evacuation of Dunkirk, he was the chief engine room artificer on board the Hebe, a minesweeper deployed to Dover as a control vessel.The Hebe crossed the Channel to Dunkirk three times during those chaotic days between 27 May and 4 June.\"It was torrid, dangerous and nerve-wracking with all-day long German air attacks\", says Harold Biles who marked his 28th birthday during the height of the bombardment.\"The Hebe was lying about 200 metres off the beach at Dunkirk, and there was just a seething mass of soldiers. All we knew was that we were on the water, they were on the beach and were trying to get to us.\"There was constant bombing and shellfire.  We just used to wait for nightfall when there was a relaxation, and we could perhaps get some sleep.\"In the early hours of 29 May 1940, the captain of HMS Hebe sent a gig ashore to the beach at Dunkirk. It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England.\"As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves. He was resplendent in his red-trimmed uniform, but he was motionless, with his head sunk to his chest\".\"It was not for him to receive any acclaim for the evacuation of some 330,000 men and saving them from Nazi POW camps. In his eyes, there was only defeat. He had lost an army.\"The German bombardment, the trauma and the fatigue were taking a toll on the crew of HMS Hebe, and no doubt other ships involved in the evacuation.My father describes how on the morning of 1 June, he witnessed the first signs of what we now know to be post-traumatic stress, but in those days was sometimes referred to as a \"lack of moral fibre\".\"We were embarking more stores and ammunition back in Dover. An RAF plane flying low overhead was the starting point. A seaman looked up, screamed and fell into convulsions with hysteria. It was contagious and he was joined by three or four others.\"Later in the day an order was issued, amazing and ill judged. Anybody feeling the stress of the last week was told to leave the ship and assemble on the dockside in preparation for going to hospital.\"About 20 men left the ship and I can still see their grins as they trooped over the gangway. The majority were malingerers but in fairness, the prospect of that final trip was frightening as the Germans were almost on the French beaches.\"The captain of the Hebe sent for Harold Biles as the Chief Engineer, and the Coxswain.\"We both had to tell him that the ship was so depleted of crew that a further sailing was impossible. And so we remained alongside while other craft made the trip, some never to return.\"To my father\\'s dismay, HMS Hebe played no further part in Operation Dynamo.\"This was the greatest blow which sometimes I feel to this day,\" he says, on the eve of his 98th birthday.\\n', 'Comrade Akaash\\'s statement comes after the rebels were blamed for Friday\\'s train crash which left 148 people dead.Police say Maoist rebels sabotaged the track, causing the derailment of the Calcutta-Mumbai express in West Bengal.Maoists denied the charge. But Comrade Akaash also said they would investigate whether any rebels were involved.Railway officials in eastern India have cancelled night trains in Maoist-affected areas after Friday\\'s incident.Comrade Akaash told the BBC that they were \"appealing\" to the railways to run trains through rebel strongholds even during the night.Profile: India\\'s Maoist rebelsIn pictures: India train collision\"We are promising total security to all trains. We will not allow anyone to attack any train anywhere in the country and those trying to do it will face stern punishment,\" he said.The railways have not reacted to the statement.Police say they have \"definite evidence\" that a local rebel Maoist militia were behind the disaster - they have named two militia leaders as the prime suspects.One of the suspects, Umakanta Mahato, was arrested last June and charged with sedition and waging war against the state.But he was released on bail in December, and the police did not contest the bail, court records say.Independent lawyers are asking why the police did not contest the bail plea of a senior Maoist militia leader.Railway officials in eastern India have cancelled night trains in Maoist-affected areas after Friday\\'s incident.The restrictions would be in place until 0500 [2330GMT] on 3 June, the company said.Report said other services were being rescheduled to ensure they travelled through Maoist areas of eastern India in daylight.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the Maoist insurgency as India\\'s biggest internal security challenge.\\n', 'His 1965 track Tears was the third biggest-selling single of the decade, according to a newly compiled chart.The Beatles occupy the top two places in the chart and have an additional three records in the Top 10.DJ Tony Blackburn counted down the Top 60 best-selling records of the 1960s in a special programme on BBC Radio Two, broadcast on Bank Holiday Monday.According to sales data compiled by the Official Charts Company, the biggest selling single of the 1960s was She Loves You by The Beatles.I Want to Hold Your Hand, recorded by the Fab Four in 1963, came second.The Unswinging SixtiesThe other Beatles records in the Top 10 are Can\\'t Buy Me Love at four, I Feel Fine at five and the double A-side We Can Work It Out/Day Tripper at seven.Yet Dodd\\'s track - which topped the UK singles chart for five weeks and was the biggest-selling single of 1965 - outsold them all.\"It comes as no surprise to see the Fab Four at number one, but other aspects of the chart are perhaps a little unexpected,\" said Blackburn.Jeff Smith, Radio 2\\'s head of music, called the chart \"a nostalgic reflection of the enduring appeal of the music of the \\'60s and the artists that defined the decade.\"Dodd, now 82, has been in showbusiness for more than 50 years.Born in Liverpool in 1927, he is best known for his buck teeth and frizzy hair, tickling stick and his creation of the Diddymen.\\n', 'Since late November, Scotland\\'s five mountain resorts have attracted 373,782 customers.The ski season is estimated to have attracted £37.5m into the local economy.With fresh snow on the slopes, CairnGorm Mountain expects skiing during the first weekend of June.Recent figures from Ski Scotland showed that this season\\'s figures were better than the last bumper season of 2000-2001.Chair of Ski Scotland Heather Negus said: \"All winter, we realised we were heading for a great season.\"We had hoped to match the figure for 2001, but didn\\'t realise we had beaten it until recently, when everything was added up - and of course, CairnGorm Mountain is still operating, so we\\'re still counting.\"It is estimated that for every pound spent on the slopes another £3 is spent in the local economy with more than £28m being spent this winter in local accommodation, cafés, bars, restaurants, shops and filling stations.Ms Negus added: \"All the ski areas have been delighted to see other local businesses thriving this winter.\"Everything really came together for us - we had lots and lots of superb snow, which kept on coming, some truly amazing overhead weather giving \\'bluebird\\' conditions, and, because there was also snow elsewhere in the UK, people realised that the Scottish Highlands did have skiing and snow boarding to rival the best and they came here to enjoy it.\"\\n', 'They are accused of kidnapping, torturing, and killing left-wing activists under the country\\'s military rule between 1976 and 1983.Human rights groups hope the trial will shed light on Operation Condor, a joint effort among South American military rulers aimed at suppressing opposition.The five have denied the charges.They include two former intelligence officers, Honorio Martinez Ruiz and Eduardo Ruffo,  former Gen Eduardo Cabanillas, former Col Ruben Visuara, and former military intelligence agent Raul Guglielminetti.A sixth man, former Vice Cmdr Nestor Guillamondegui, was excused from the trial on health grounds, court officials said.They said his health would be monitored to determine if he could face trial at a later date.The men are accused of having run a notorious detention centre in Buenos Aires.More than 200 people are believed to have been kidnapped and taken to the secret prison, known as Automotores Orletti.Most of the detained were from Uruguay, but survivors say it also housed prisoners from Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia and Cuba.Condor was devised in 1975 by military officials from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.Its aim was to silence the opposition by sending teams into other countries to track, monitor and kill dissidents.A prosecutor said what happened at Automotores Orletti was \"calculated and planned and amounted to a death sentence\" for the prisoners.Marcelo Gelman, the son of Argentine poet Juan Gelman, was one of those detained in the clandestine prison in 1976. His body was later found in a cement-filled drum dumped in a river.His wife, Maria Claudia Garcia, was pregnant when she was abducted. She was taken to Uruguay, where she was disappeared.Their daughter, Macarena Gelman, was raised by a police officer in Uruguay.  She says she will testify at the trial, which is expected to last months.\\n', \"The action sports game, based on Mexican 'Lucha Libre' style wrestling, sees players compete in arenas used by official administrative body the AAA (Asistencia AsesorÃ\\xada y AdministraciÃ³n) and other traditional Mexican settings.Traditional Mexican wrestling is a fast-paced sport, with competitors donning colourful costumes, masks and make up.Popular in Mexico for more than 100 years, the sport has expanded into the United States and has started to gain fans across the globe.Players of the video game have 30 wrestling characters to choose from.As is the case in real life wrestling, the aim of the game is both to win and to avoid humiliation - in the Mask vs. Hair contest the loser either has their head shaved on stage or forfeits their trademark wrestling mask for life; the ultimate symbol of pride for many real Lucha Libre wrestlers.To mark the launch, Hispanic publisher Slang staged a real life Lucha Libre event in the middle of E3. The winner was Dr. Wagner Jr, and his prize was to become the main image on the game's packaging.Due for release in August this year on all console and hand-held formats, the game will ship with a single player campaign that will let players customise and improve their character, coupled with an online match-up that sees users enter forfeit matches, such as Mask vs. Hair.Mexican wrestlers have appeared in video games such as Tekken and Street Fighter IV before, but this is the first time that a game dedicated to Lucha Libra has been released.The developers say that future editions are already in the works.\\n\", 'Harper Lee\\'s classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote.Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing.She doesn\\'t give interviews - \"Hell, no\" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue.But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason.Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York.\"She asked me, \\'You ever wonder why I didn\\'t write anything else?\\' And I said, \\'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.\\' And she said, \\'Well, what do you think?\\'\"Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn\\'t need to compete with herself.\"And when I got through she said, \\'You\\'re all wrong.\\' I said, \\'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.\\' She said, \\'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.\\'\"And she said, \\'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.\\'\"Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation.He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.\"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me.\"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.\"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\"But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town\\'s other literary icon, Truman Capote.Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.The town\\'s residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.\"Being famous I\\'m sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,\" the Rev Butts says. \"She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.\"\\n', 'Those who participated in the Aberdeen Children of the 1950s project, which saw all primary pupils aged seven to 12 surveyed by the Medical Research Council in 1962, have been contacted.They have been asked to take part in the Scottish Family Health Study, which is recruiting 50,000 people.It aims to investigate why diseases such as cancer can run in families.Those recruited will have their health tracked, with the intention of creating a Scottish \"bio-bank\" containing genetic, medical and family history and lifestyle information.This will allow researchers to investigate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to common conditions.Blair Smith, a GP and professor of primary care medicine at Aberdeen University, will run the project.He said: \"We know that many diseases such as cancer, heart disease, mental illness and diabetes run in families and that tells us that genes are important.\"But we don\\'t know yet which genes are important or how they relate to other things such as lifestyle.\"We can get more information about genes by studying DNA which carries the genetic blueprint handed down through the generations.\"That is why we are collecting and analysing blood samples and health information from thousands of families across Scotland.\"He said the data gathered would help future research into the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of illnesses.\\n', 'It needs to raise £100,000 to save the 1733 portrait of Gambian Ayuba Suleiman Diallo, by artist William Hoare.The Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the NPG will all contribute to the total cost, which is £555,000.The portrait, which has never been seen in public, has temporarily gone on show at the London gallery.Diallo, who was from a prosperous family of religious clerics, was captured as a slave in Africa at the age of 29 and was transported to work on a plantation in America.Read Will\\'s blogAfter he was imprisoned for trying to escape, he met lawyer Thomas Bluett who, impressed by Diallo\\'s intellect and education, took him to England.Diallo was received with great enthusiasm by aristocrats and scholars.The National Portrait Gallery said Hoare\\'s painting was the first British portrait that honoured a named African subject as an individual and an equal.A spokesman for the gallery told the BBC News website that the work - which had been in a private collection - had sold at auction in Christie\\'s in London in December for £554,937.50.Following the sale, then Culture Minister Margaret Hodge put a temporary export bar on the painting and gave British museums and galleries the opportunity to buy it if they could match the price.The Heritage Lottery Fund and The Art Fund have already given grants of £333,000 and £100,000, while the NPG has also contributed.The Lottery Fund\\'s grant will go towards the acquisition, as well as the costs of conserving, displaying and touring the painting around other galleries and museums in the UK.Broadcaster and National Portrait Gallery trustee, Zeinab Badawi, said: \"This portrait is a rare example of a painting of an 18th Century African in Britain.\"This portrait would be a vital and powerful addition to the collection at the National Portrait Gallery for its representation of Britain\\'s diverse cultural heritage.\"\\n', 'A proposed amendment to the Finance Bill by the SNP and Plaid Cymru, which would have prevented the increase, was defeated by a majority of 295.A Labour-backed amendment calling for the move to be delayed pending an assessment of its impact on vulnerable groups was also defeated.Ministers have said the tax rise is \"unavoidable\" to reduce the deficit.In a further vote, MPs approved the VAT rise by 321 to 246, a government majority of 75.The votes came during a lengthy debate on the bill, which enacts last month\\'s Budget, in the Commons.Chancellor George Osborne has said the planned rise in the main rate of VAT from 17.5% to 20% is estimated to raise Â£13bn towards reducing the Â£155bn deficit.The move was controversial as the Conservatives said they had \"no plans\" to raise it during the election while the Lib Dems attacked the Tories - now their now-coalition partners - saying their plans would necessitate a \"VAT bombshell\".But neither the Conservatives, Labour nor the Lib Dems ruled out raising VAT before the general election.MPs discussed a group of 16 opposition amendments - including a bid by the SNP to scrap the rise altogether and several Labour amendments, including one which would delay the VAT rise until the government has assessed its impact on pensioners, children and those on low fixed incomes.The SNP amendment was defeated by 316 votes to 21.Another Labour amendment, which was also defeated, would have exempted groups such as charities, local authorities and other groups from the VAT rise.A Lib Dem MP, Andrew George, tabled an amendment to peg the rise to just 0.5% - from 17.5% to 18%.\"Of all the measures to restore the public finances it seems to me that a VAT rise has to be among the least welcome of all of the alternatives,\" he told MPs.Treasury minister David Gauke said VAT was \"one of the few levers available\" to the government to address the shortfall in the public finances.\"Any sensible government would consider it. And, given the circumstances we\\'re in, any government would do it.\" He added: \"We had to raise VAT because there was no money left.\"But shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Liam Byrne said Britain\\'s pensioners may face \"an Â£8bn VAT bill over the course of this Parliament\".In an interview with the BBC\\'s Daily Politics earlier, shadow chancellor Alistair Darling confirmed Labour had looked at raising VAT to 18% or 19% and said he did \"not have a philosophic problem with that\" as long as \"you do something to help people on low fixed incomes\" like pensioners and to ease the effect of spending cuts.He said Labour\\'s amendment was not a \"blanket refusal to put up VAT\" but a \"reasoned and considered amendment\" which was calling on the government to do more to help those worst hit by a VAT rise.\\n', 'Police have confirmed paint was thrown over doors and windows at Crumlin Orange Hall some time between 2300 BST on Monday and 1000 BST on Tuesday.SDLP South Antrim MLA Thomas Burns condemned those behind the attack which he said was \"pointless\".\"They can only harm and destroy, they can only cause pain and hardship and useless expense to taxpayers and ratepayers,\" he said.\\n', 'Up to six shots were fired at police during a third night of violence in north Belfast on Tuesday.Petrol bombs and a pipe bomb were also thrown by nationalist rioters in the Ardoyne area. About 100 officers used water cannon and baton rounds.The prime minister has said the PSNI behaved in a brave and restrained way during the recent trouble.Speaking in the Commons, Prime Minister David Cameron described the violence as \"unacceptable\" and said the PSNI had been forced to respond.On Wednesday, Assistant Chief Constable Duncan McCausland said children as young as 10 were involved in the violence.He said as well as throwing stones and petrol bombs, young children were being used as shields by \"sinister elements\" organising the riots behind them.ACC McCausland said police had hours of video footage from before the violence started and would use it to identify the rioters.\"There will be significant arrests in the forthcoming days - individuals will not go scot free,\" he said.The rioter who dropped a concrete block on a policewoman on Monday night - seriously injuring her - had already been identified he added.\"Wherever he is in Northern Ireland he can sit and be worried - we will be coming for him,\" he said.The officer is due to get out of hospital later on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the NI first and deputy first ministers have met the chief constable.Following the meeting, Peter Robinson said he had \"nothing but the highest admiration for the way the police has dealt with the difficulties of recent days\".Martin McGuinness described the violence as a \"setback against the huge progress we have made in recent times\".But he insisted that those behind the violence \"would not succeed\" in disrupting the political process.The NI Chief Constable, Matt Baggott, said his force was determined to bring those responsible to justice.Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness were criticised on Tuesday by Assistant Chief Constable Alistair Finlay, who called on them to provide more leadership.On Wednesday, searches were carried out in the Ardoyne area in relation to the recent trouble and a number of items were taken away for further examination.A 20-year-old man was also charged with riotous behaviour in connection with an incident during an Orange Order march in the Ormeau Road area on 12 July. He is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on Thursday.On Tuesday night in Ardoyne, burning barricades were put in place and laser pens were shone at police. Some officers suffered minor injuries.Politicians have condemned the violence, which has flared at the height of the loyalist marching season.Sinn Fein have said dissident republicans and \"anti-social elements\" are behind the violence.SDLP councillor Nicola Mallon spent most of Tuesday night in Ardoyne and said it as a night of \"absolute madness and mayhem\" with local residents growing increasingly worried about the situation.Northern Ireland\\'s Justice Minister David Ford said there was an \"extremely sinister edge\", in terms of those who were encouraging the rioting.There was also trouble in North Queen Street area of north Belfast on Tuesday night where youths built a barricade across the road.In the Markets area of south Belfast a bus was damaged by stone-throwers and a car was recovered by police as youths tried to hijack it.A car was also stolen in Lurgan, County Armagh and four petrol bombs were thrown at a police vehicle in Londonderry.More than 80 police officers had been injured over the previous two nights of rioting by nationalist youths.Police later released aerial footage of the violence, which showed officers coming under sustained attack from people throwing bricks and wielding metal bars and planks.The chief constable, Matt Baggott, said the cost of policing Monday\\'s violence would run into millions of pounds.\\n', 'Giving evidence to the Iraq inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller said the action had radicalised \"a few among a generation\".As a result, she said she was not \"surprised\" that UK nationals were involved in the 7/7 bombings in London.She said she believed the intelligence on Iraq\\'s threat was not \"substantial enough\" to justify the action.Baroness Manningham-Buller said she had advised officials a year before the war that the threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited\", and she believed that assessment had \"turned out to be the right judgement\".Describing the intelligence on Iraq\\'s weapons threat as \"fragmentary\", she said: \"If you are going to go to war, you need to have a pretty high threshold to decide on that.\"In a previously secret document from 2002, Baroness Manningham-Buller wrote to the Home Office saying: \"We assess that Saddam is only likely to order terrorist attacks if he perceives that the survival of his regime is threatened.\"The Chilcot inquiry is continuing to hear evidence about decisions taken in the build-up to the invasion and its aftermath.Baroness Manningham-Buller, head of the domestic intelligence service between 2002 and 2007, said the terrorist threat to the UK from al-Qaeda and other groups \"pre-dated\" the Iraq invasion and also the 9/11 attacks in the US.However, she said the UK\\'s participation in the March 2003 military action \"undoubtedly increased\" the level of terrorist threat.By Peter BilesBBC correspondent at the inquiryThe former head of MI5 chose her words very carefully.Baroness Manningham-Buller was giving her evidence in public, although 35 witnesses have previously testified to the Iraq inquiry behind closed doors in order to protect national security or international relations.Key to her evidence was the release of the declassified assessment which she wrote in March 2002, a year before the invasion of Iraq.This played down the direct threat to the UK from Saddam Hussein\\'s regime, and its possible links to al-Qaeda.As was expected, the focus of her evidence remained on the implications of the 2003 invasion for Britain, rather than the actual decision to go to war.Given the gravity of the situation, with 16 suspected terrorism plots uncovered in the UK between 2001 and 2008, it may be a surprise to some that she did not have direct conversations with Tony Blair during her time as head of MI5.A year after the invasion, she said MI5 was \"swamped\" by leads about terrorist threats to the UK.\"Our involvement in Iraq, for want of a better word, radicalised a whole generation of young people, some of them British citizens who saw our involvement in Iraq, on top of our involvement in Afghanistan, as being an attack on Islam,\" she said, before immediately correcting herself by adding \"not a whole generation, a few among a generation\".The ex-MI5 chief said she shared her concerns that the Iraq invasion would increase the UK\\'s exposure to terrorism with the then home secretary David Blunkett, but did not \"recall\" discussing the matter with Prime Minister Tony Blair.MI5 did not \"foresee the degree to which British citizens would become involved\" in terrorist activity after 2004, she admitted.\"What Iraq did was produce fresh impetus on people prepared to engage in terrorism,\" she said, adding that she could produce evidence to back this up.\"The Iraq war heightened the extremist view that the West was trying to bring down Islam. We gave Bin Laden his jihad.\"Lady Manningham-Buller said MI5 was given a budget increase after 9/11 and again in 2002 but the agency still needed far greater resources as a result of the Iraq invasion.\"By 2003 I found it necessary to ask the prime minister for a doubling of our budget,\" she said. \"This is unheard of, certainly unheard of today, but he and the Treasury and the chancellor accepted that, because I was able to demonstrate the scale of the problem that we were confronted by.\"Baroness Manningham-Buller was part of the government\\'s Joint Intelligence Committee before the war, which drew up the controversial dossier on Iraq\\'s alleged weapons of mass destruction in September 2002. The dossier stated the weapons could be activated with 45 minutes of an order to do so.Asked about the dossier, she said she had very limited involvement in its compilation but it was clear, with hindsight, that there was an \"over-reliance\" on certain intelligence.She added: \"We were asked to put in some low-grade, small intelligence into it and we refused because we did not think that it was reliable.\"She said MI5\\'s responsibility was to collect and analyse intelligence and to \"act on it where necessary\" to mitigate terrorist threats, but stressed it was not her job \"to fill in gaps\" in the intelligence.A year before the war, the former MI5 chief advised Home Office officials that the direct threat posed by Iraq to the UK was \"very limited and containable\".In a newly declassified document, published by the inquiry, Baroness Manningham-Buller told the senior civil servant at the Home Office in March 2002 that there was no evidence that Iraq had any involvement in the 9/11 attacks.While there were reports of links between the regime of Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, there was no intelligence to suggest meaningful co-operation between the two.In that letter, she said the possibility Iraq might use terrorist tactics to defend its own territory in the event of an invasion could not be ruled out.But she stressed Iraqi agents did not have \"much capability\" to carry out UK attacks, adding her view of this never changed.In his evidence in January, Tony Blair described Saddam Hussein as a \"monster\" and said the world was a safer place with him no longer in control of Iraq.\\n']\n",

Once this work is complete, the structure will then go to Astrium\\'s Toulouse, France, facility for final preparations.The European Space Agency (Esa) satellite is due for launch in 2012 on a Soyuz rocket from the new Sinnamary spaceport in French Guiana.Gaia is a successor to Europe\\'s Hipparcos space astrometry mission which ran in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  It catalogued more than 100,000 stars in our galaxy.The new mission is a step change in capability, however.  Its billion-pixel camera system will give scientists an unprecedented 3D map of the sky.Over a five-year period, it will chart the precise positions, distances, movements, luminosities, and changes in brightness of stars.  These details will unlock new information about the structure, origin and evolution of our Milky Way Galaxy.And because Gaia will track anything that passes across its field of vision, it is likely also to see countless objects that had hitherto gone unrecorded - such as asteroids, planets beyond our Solar System, and tepid stars that never quite fired into life.What you see in the image at the top of this page is Gaia\\'s electrical and service module.This is the part of the satellite that will do all of the \"housekeeping\" in space. It contains elements such as the attitude and orbit control system, the avionics, the computer and data handling subsystems. A large antenna will go underneath the structure to allow Gaia to talk to Earth.What you do not see here is the payload module that will eventually go on top.  This will be the unit that contains Gaia\\'s telescopes and camera system.Nor do you see the thermal shield which will open - petal-like - from the underside of the service module to give protection to Gaia\\'s sensitive optics.\"Gaia came to Stevenage about a year ago as a bare structure,\" said the Astrium UK Gaia project manager, Andy Whitehouse.\"Since then we\\'ve integrated the propulsion system.  We\\'ve built all of that offline and then put it on the structure.  There\\'s a lot of pipework that runs around inside, and the tanks are also inside as well.\"Mark Tomlin, the assembly and integration test manager, added: \"There wasn\\'t much time to bring all this together.  We\\'ve done almost 500 welds on the mechanical service module and that\\'s taken us on the order of six months to achieve.  It\\'s been a monumental task.  Each weld has to be X-rayed and cleaned.\"As a lead member state of the European Space Agency, the UK is playing a prominent role on the mission, both scientifically and industrially.The immense array of camera detectors, or CCDs (charge-coupled devices), is being provided by e2v at Chelmsford.\"The bulk of the work going on here at Astrium UK is on the electrical side, not the mechanical side,\" observed Dr Ralph Cordey, the company\\'s head of science.\"This includes the crucial onboard processing units, which turn the prodigious amounts of data Gaia will get from its CCDs into a data stream that can be sent to Earth.\"Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\\n', 'Camilla bought a box of mangoes with a Brixton Â£10 note, introduced last year to try to keep the money of local people within the community.The couple were surrounded by shoppers as they walked along Electric Avenue.They came to Brixton to see work which has started to revitalise the borough.It was Charles\\' first visit to the area since 1996, when he was accompanied by the former South African president Nelson Mandela.Greengrocer Derek Chong, who has run a stall on Electric Avenue for 20 years, said Camilla had been \"nice and pleasant\" when she purchased the fruit.\"She asked me what was nice, what would I recommend, and I said we\\'ve got some nice mangoes.\"She asked me were they ripe and I said yes - they\\'re from the Dominican Republic.\"Mr Chong is one of 170 local retailers who accept the Brixton Pound.Customers exchange traditional pound coins for Brixton Pounds and then spend them at the market or in participating shops.During the visit, Prince Charles spent time talking to youth worker Marcus West, who works with children nearby on an estate off Coldharbour Lane.Mr West said: \"He\\'s on the level, really down-to-earth. They were very cheery.

And President Hu Jintao has said many times that peaceful development is a strategic choice of the Chinese government.Prof Geoff Wade, a historian who has translated Ming documents relating to Zheng\\'s voyages, disputes the portrayal of a benign adventurer.He says the historical records show the treasure fleets carried sophisticated weaponry and participated in at least three major military actions; in Java, Sumatra and Sri Lanka.\"Because there is virtually no critical analysis of these texts even now - history writing is still in the hands of the state - it\\'s very difficult for Chinese people to conceive of the state as being dangerous, expansionist, or offensive in any way to its neighbours.\"Chinese nationalism is fed on ignorance of its past relations. The way Zheng He is being represented is part of this.\"The International Zheng He Society in Singapore disputes this \"Western thought\", and says the battles that Zheng was embroiled in were either retaliatory or an effort to rid the high seas of pirates.\"These incidents were hardly the nature of true battle but, instead, vividly signify the peaceful diplomacy of Zheng He,\" said spokesman Chen Jian Chin.Many layers of myth surround China\\'s ancient mariner. According to Kenyan lore, some of his shipwrecked sailors survived and were allowed to stay and marry local women.DNA tests have reportedly shown evidence of Chinese ancestry and a young Kenyan woman, Mwamaka Shirafu, was given a scholarship to study Chinese medicine in China, where she now resides.\"She\\'s as much a symbol of international peace and friendship as any historical legacy,\" says Prof Wade.\\n', 'The works on Gdynia Way near Plymouth\\'s city centre have been in place since June to widen the road to three lanes.But police said they had seen an increase in the number of collisions on the Maxwell Road, Macadam Road junction.Plymouth City Council (PCC) said a new set of temporary traffic lights would be put on the junction.Pc Ian Tanner, Plymouth\\'s road casualty reduction officer said: \"There have been some collisions since the new system was put in place, with four or five injury collisions in that area.\"The council are diverting quite large volumes of traffic on to roads that, although perfectly up to the job, people don\\'t usually travel on, and as a result it hasn\\'t worked as well as we would have liked it to.\"It\\'s a balancing act for the council, as to what is the best thing to do, to keep the traffic moving as well as they can and to keep the level of injuries down.\"Pc Tanner added that the increase in collisions could also be a result of drivers, familiar with the route, not reading new signs properly.In a statement, PCC said: \"During the last couple of months it has become apparent that there could be further improvements to the revised junction layout.\"The decision to install temporary lights has been made after routine discussions with various stakeholders including the police.\"The lights will reinforce the changed priorities and help drivers negotiate this junction.\"The council said that up to 1,000 drivers used the junction each hour.The new traffic lights will give priority to traffic travelling between Plymstock and the city centre in the morning and vice versa in the evening, until the work is completed in October.\\n', 'The Curriculum for Excellence, which has been four years in the making, aims to give teachers more freedom and make lessons less prescriptive.Some teachers, unions and opposition parties have expressed concern the curriculum is not ready.But Scottish ministers have given assurances it will improve standards.Education Secretary Mike Russell said the current system was not being largely re-written.The changes, for children between the ages of three and 18, which are already in place in primary schools, aim to focus more on teaching methods rather than content, and seek to make young people more resourceful and responsible.The system will be introduced for children in their first year of secondary school, and will be rolled out year on year until it is implemented for all secondary years.Speaking on BBC radio\\'s Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Russell said, \"We already know that in the primary sector, this is a successful means of imparting education.\"The rules of physics and the grammar of French don\\'t change as a result of that, but what does happen is that teaching methods improve.\"I\\'m confident that it will produce the results that Scotland needs - a well-educated group of young people and a well-educated work force.\"However, Eleanor Coner of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council told BBC Scotland that although related exams are still a few years off, parents are concerned about the lack of communication over the new curriculum.She said: \"I was speaking to a parent last night who said she just can\\'t get her head round it and that she just doesn\\'t understand anything about it.\"I think the problem is that the messages that have been sent out can be quite confusing at times. There needs to be more information like this on what is happening, and this is what it means for your child.\"Mr Russell said he had written to the parents of each child affected by the new system, and he had been visiting schools around the country to speak to parents and teachers.Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems have raised concerns that the new curriculum is still too vague and have questioned whether enough funding has been made available to deliver it.In March, Mr Russell rejected calls by secondary teachers to delay the introduction of the curriculum.Some unions have expressed concerns that their members will not be ready to introduce the new system and pledged to create specialist groups in subject areas to provide the right support.Labour education spokesman Des McNulty claimed SNP cuts were a threat to the new curriculum.He said: \"Newly qualified teachers are unable to get jobs and school budgets are under their tightest pressure than at any point in the last decade because the SNP have failed to prioritise our schools.\"The vital materials and information needed for the successful implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence has not yet been provided and many teachers feel the support they were promised has not been delivered by the SNP.\"The Liberal Democrats said they supported the curriculum but said Mr Russell\\'s handling of the situation was \"shambolic\".Education spokeswoman Margaret Smith said: \"I\\'m pleased that teachers are excited about teaching the new curriculum, but as children return to school today, there are still no criteria for the new national exams replacing Standard Grades.\"Teachers have to start teaching the new curriculum, but with no idea about the exams that they should be preparing children for.\"\\n', 'Sir Philip, owner of clothing retailer Arcadia Group, will examine expenditure from the past three years to try to identify potential savings.He told the BBC more centralised buying by government departments might help.But the appointment was criticised by the GMB union - who said that Sir Philip\\'s wife, the direct owner of Arcadia, lives in a tax haven.Sir Philip owns more than 2,000 shops in the UK, including BHS and Topshop, which are estimated to make up some 12% of the nation\\'s clothing retail market.His conclusions will inform the wider Comprehensive Spending Review due in October.Sir Philip Green is one of the UK\\'s most successful retailers.With a personal fortune of more than £4bn, he owns the Arcadia Group, whose fashion chains include Topshop, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Miss Selfridge.In 2009 Arcadia made pre-tax profits of £213.6m, 13% higher than the previous year.Sir Philip also owns department store chain BHS, whose fortunes he has transformed since he purchased the then ailing company in 2000.The government will be hoping that Sir Philip can transfer his renowned ability to trim costs from the private sector to the civil service.He will also bring a proven record in procurement, and aims to reduce the cost of the government\\'s purchasing contracts.However, despite Sir Philip\\'s successes, his appointment may still raise eyebrows.His wife Tina is the direct owner of Arcadia, and she is officially a resident of Monaco. This enabled her to gain a tax-free £1.2bn dividend in 2005.Sir Philip also made headlines in 2004 when he made a failed hostile takeover bid for Marks and Spencer.He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme he had \"no idea\" how much could be saved yet, but added: \"We need to get ourselves focused on the big spending, where is the money actually being spent.\"I think in the past, occasionally having had discussions on this, there is not central procurement.\"So the thought process of us having an individual buyer in each one of our stores without centralising the purchasing, will give you some idea, hopefully, of the opportunity.\"But it\\'s about process as well, so we need to understand the process, how it\\'s done, who does what and how we can quicken all of that up.\"But his appointment was criticised by Paul Kenny, head of the GMB union, who  pointed out that Sir Philip\\'s wife - the named owner of Arcadia - lives in the tax haven of Monaco.He said: \"If we were seeking advice about marketing or selling clothes he is someone you might ask. This is about the health, education and care of millions of our fellow citizens - not about importing cheap clothing.\"And the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents civil servants, said: \"It\\'s not that surprising that the millionaires in the cabinet have appointed a billionaire to say that their cuts, which will devastate communities in the UK, are \\'fair\\'.\"But Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude defended Sir Philip\\'s appointment, saying he had a \"sharp eye for detail\" and could guide the government on contracts and leases signed up to in future.\"He\\'s shown how he can turn around big complex businesses. Government is a huge complex organisation, and while it\\'s not the same as a business, a lot of the same disciplines are needed,\" he added.Asked about the tax status of his wife, Sir Philip told the BBC: \"My wife\\'s not a tax exile - my family do not live in the United Kingdom, it\\'s somewhat different.\"He added: \"We do pay all our tax in Britain. I think we have paid over the last five years some £300-400m in taxes on profits that have been made on our company.\"I\\'m a UK taxpayer, I work here every week, we employ 45,000 people in the UK and we have got a £500m payroll.\"Sir Philip will be supported by a team of civil servants and report to Mr Maude and Chief Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander - who said the review would help the government \"totally re-think\" the way it spends public money.\\n', 'The 1949 Delahaye Roadster, which some have dubbed the most beautiful car in the world, was given to Dors when she was 17.The sky blue car has been described by auctioneers as \"extravagant and outrageous - a rolling sculpture\".Dors, who was seen as the British Marilyn Monroe, died in 1984 aged 52.Born Diana Mary Fluck, Dors became known as a 1950s blonde sex symbol, but was also well-respected for her acting skills.RM auctioneers said the car was curvaceous, sexy and flamboyant, just like its former owner.It was expected to sell for up to $6m but went for $3m plus a buyer\\'s premium of 10%.The car is one of only 150 Roadsters made, and only one of 51 of its specific model - the 175S.The company stopped production in 1951 as it found there was little demand for such extravagance during that post-war period.When Dors first received the car, she did not even have a driving licence.At 20, she became the youngest owner of a Rolls-Royce in the UK - a reflection of her success at an early age.After she died, the car changed ownership several times and has in recent years been restored to its former condition.In its catalogue listing, RM Auctions says the Roadster - which has a top speed of 70mph - can \"easily claim to being the most extravagant and beautiful coachbulit car in existence\".\\n', 'Youngsters are returning to school this week in Scotland, with parents in other areas of the UK preparing children for the next academic year.They are able to buy school shirts for ??1 and sweaters for ??2.But rising cotton and wool prices mean it is unlikely that uniform prices can fall any further, Neil Saunders, of Verdict Research, said.The big four UK supermarket chains - Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury\\'s and Morrisons - as well as Marks and Spencer, are selling the constituent parts of a generic school uniform for less than ??5 each.For example, Asda is selling a white shirt for ??1, Sainsbury\\'s has put a ??2 price tag on grey and black trousers, and Tesco has blue and green sweaters on sale for ??1.75.Although labour costs are low as many of these items are manufactured in Bangladesh and China, the margin for these items is still extremely slim.The supermarkets accept this owing to the brand loyalty they gain from customers, who buy uniforms at cheap prices and then stay in the store to buy other goods such as school accessories and groceries.The price war is unusual and prices for many other items are rising.Plus-size school uniforms launchThe picture is also different for parents who must buy uniforms from specialist suppliers. Owing to prescriptive demands of these uniforms, prices tend to be higher than the generic supermarket clothes.Verdict Research estimates the UK school uniform market to be worth ??694m.The average price of a standard uniform has fallen by almost 21% since 2004, it said, with supermarkets increasing their market share.However, the total value of uniform and equipment sales has fallen from ??861m in 2004 to ??694m, the research group said.Neil Saunders, of Verdict, said that the quality of uniforms tended not to be at the same level as a decade ago.\"As long as they last, parents are not too concerned,\" he said.\"Children run around in these things, rip holes in them, and they fall apart anyway.

Marks and Spencer said the trial range followed demand from parents.\\n', 'The keynote MacTaggart Lecture will be given by the director general of the BBC, Mark Thompson, at what is a crucial time for the corporation.Last year during the keynote Edinburgh speech, one of the BBC\\'s biggest competitors, James Murdoch, launched an outspoken attack on the corporation.He called its \"dominant\" scale \"chilling\" and said that it should be \"far, far smaller\".The BSkyB chairman - who also runs much of News Corporation, the publisher of The Times, Sunday Times, Sun and the News of the World - expressed particular concern over the public funding of the BBC\\'s news output, which he called \"state-sponsored journalism\".He claimed it was a \"threat to the plurality and independence of news provision\", because it made it hard for commercial publishers to earn money from their own news websites.To some of his audience, the idea of \"state-sponsored journalism\" was over the top.But, worryingly for the BBC, Murdoch\\'s general point that the corporation was too big and was harming its commercial rivals, drew murmurs of agreement from other media owners and politicians.Since then, the BBC has found itself under almost constant fire, not least in the newspapers which now compete with it, as they extend their businesses onto the internet.In this year\\'s MacTaggart Lecture, Mr Thompson must try to win round the corporation\\'s critics, including some of those commercial rivals and politicians.But he must also set out his vision for the BBC, as a publicly-funded news and cultural organisation in a world of rapidly changing technology and behaviour - and tighter public finances.The BBC has been widely criticised for the large sums of licence fee money it pays to its stars and top managers.In the new age of public austerity, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt says much needs changing at the BBC.He has given notice that the next licence fee negotiations - when they begin in a year\\'s time - will be very tough.Viewers, he says, can expect to pay less.Belatedly, the BBC has responded to some of the criticisms.Senior executives\\' pay has been published, then frozen, and bonuses withdrawn.The highest-paid managers are giving up a month\\'s pay for the next two years and will be asked to withdraw from a scheme which tops up their pensions.The BBC is to publish the names of its highest-paid presenters and performers and it has proposed radical cuts to its staff pension scheme, to cope with a large deficit.But that in turn has alienated many BBC employees, who are less highly paid.Unions are balloting their members for strike action.Other staff are unhappy because their jobs are moving to the north of England, while executives leading the move are keeping their own homes in the south.Mark Thompson must address all of these different concerns and audiences.Yet he is also expected to point out that the BBC has much to be proud of.It still has high support from the public, and large and appreciative audiences for its television, radio and online services.Innovations such as the BBC website and iPlayer have added to the public benefit provided by the corporation in recent years.When, asked to make cuts, it tries to close a service such as the digital radio station 6 Music, there is an outcry.On the eve of Mr Thompson\\'s speech, the case for the BBC has been eloquently argued by two academics in what they call An Appeal to the New Parliament in Defence of a British Institution.Professor Steven Barnett and Professor Jean Seaton, of the University of Westminster, call on Parliament to remember \"the huge affection in which the BBC is held by the British public, the worldwide admiration which it attracts, and the immeasurable importance of the democratic and cultural contribution which it makes to British life\".The BBC director general could hardly put it better himself. Whether he does so remains to be seen.\\n', 'He passed away peacefully in hospital on Tuesday after a short illness.Born in Tourmakeady, County Mayo, he worked as a teacher before securing a part in the premiere of the Brian Friel play Translations in 1980.Lally became a household name in Ireland for his role as Miley Byrne in the RTE soap opera Glenroe and later starred in the BBC series Ballykissangel.He also appeared in the Hollywood movie Alexander and provided the voice for the Oscar-nominated, animated Irish film, The Secret of Kells.As a fluent Irish speaker and advocate of the language, Lally had roles in several Irish language films.He is survived by his wife Peggy and their children Saileog, Darach and Maghnus.\\n', 'Andal Ampatuan Junior is accused of orchestrating the murder of 57 unarmed civilians, who were ambushed, killed and clumsily buried in a mass grave in the southern province of Maguindanao last November.Another 27 members of his family have also been charged in connection with the killings - five are with him in custody - and they all deny the charges against them.But for many Filipinos, this trial is about much more than establishing the guilt or innocence of one man, or even one family.It\\'s about the huge influence of clans like the Ampatuans, and the culture of impunity surrounding them.While their involvement in the massacre has yet to be proven, there is no doubt whatsoever that the Ampatuans were - and still are - extremely powerful.The Ampatuans have been in Maguindanao for centuries, and can trace their lineage to a Muslim preacher, Shariff Aguak, who was one of the first people to bring the Islamic faith to the area.But they were not always the dominant force they are today. According to Arnold Esguerra, a history professor at the University of the Philippines in Manila, the surname Ampatuan only started to appear in official documents in the early part of the 20th Century.At that stage they were influential traders, he said - but their social status was definitely beneath that of the \"datus\", the traditional clan rulers.The situation changed in the mid-1970s, when then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, and tried to stamp out the growing Islamic separatist movement by selecting a few people he could trust to administer the province.One of those people was Andal Ampatuan Junior\\'s father, Andal Senior, who is now the undisputed head of the family clan.First, he became the mayor of Maganoy town - and then, during the presidency of Cory Aquino, he was given the more powerful role of officer-in-charge.But it was under President Gloria Arroyo, who came to power in 2001, when the Ampatuans really came to prominence.Andal Senior became governor of Maguindanao, a post he has now held for the maximum three terms.  Then in 2005 his son Zaldy became the governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao - an influential post controlling the five Muslim provinces that have been given a degree of self-rule from central government.\\'Heights of power\\'Andal Junior became mayor of Datu Unsay, a town that bears his nickname, and at the time of the massacre, 10 of Maguindanao\\'s 34 municipalities were run by Ampatuans or their relatives.Mrs Arroyo\\'s government was good to the Ampatuans, providing funds for the region, and in the process propelling Andal Senior to \"undreamed-of heights of power\", according to a report by the International Crisis Group.In 2006, Mrs Arroyo issued an executive order legalising the informal private \"armies\" being kept by families like the Ampatuans, enabling them to work alongside the regular army - but by extension legitimising their use as a means of local control.In return the Ampatuans openly supported her in election campaigns.There are widespread claims that the family helped rig votes for Mrs Arroyo in the controversial 2004 election, which she narrowly won. Both the Ampatuans and the former president deny the allegations.At the time of the massacre, the clan had an estimated 28 mansions, scores of luxury cars, large amounts of rice-producing land and a heavily armed private army of more than 2,000 men.According to the International Crisis Group, the Ampatuans also controlled the police, the judiciary and the local election commission, and possessed mortars, rocket launchers and assault rifles.Even now, after the finger of blame has been pointed at them for the November massacre, the family still retains a lot of its influence. At least 15 Ampatuans won victories in May\\'s election - some of whom have charges against them.And according to Jessica Evans from Human Rights Watch, Andal Senior is still able to give orders to his subordinates from inside jail.Of course none of this means the Ampatuans are necessarily guilty of the killings, or that all members of the clan act in a similar way.In fact, according to Amina Rasul, director of the Philippine Council on Islam and Democracy, some Ampatuans are very effective and popular community leaders.\"They\\'re not all cut from the same cloth. Many are professional, and have real support,\" she said.But human rights groups are still concerned about the dominance of these family clans, and they warn that the influence and power exhibited by the Ampatuans is by no means unique.\"I don\\'t think this is an isolated incident,\" said Amina Rasul. \"There are other families in other parts of the Philippines that are just as powerful.\"The Philippine military recently admitted that there were at least 112 private armies around the country - an indication, perhaps, of how many more clans and family groups hold sway over their own private fiefdoms.Whether by chance or design, presidential policies over the past few decades have given certain families the opportunity to amass extraordinary levels of power and influence.The first priority of the trial into last November\\'s massacre is undoubtedly to bring justice for those who were so brutally killed.But human rights groups are hoping that the case will also persuade the current government, under President Benigno Aquino, to bring an end to the dominance of families like the Ampatuans.\\n', 'Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home.Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home.The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas.Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular.Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches.(% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable)England\\'s School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else.Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: \"Every parent knows it\\'s a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate.\"School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet.\"Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: \"Getting children to eat healthily is every parent\\'s dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged.\"From Mumsnetters\\' experience it seems that once at school there\\'s a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat.\"School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety.\"School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines.About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools.More children in Scotland eat school lunches -

After talking to doctors at the hospital, the PM decided to fly to be with his father and mother Mary.Downing Street said French President Nicolas Sarkozy had arranged a helicopter to take Mr Cameron to the hospital so he could see his father.Sources told the Press Association he was \"incredibly grateful\" as he may not otherwise have been able to get there in time and was \"relieved\" to have been at his bedside.By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC NewsTo David Cameron his father was a hero, a man who never complained about his disability and a key inspiration behind the \\'Big Society\\' theme that characterised the Conservative election campaign.In a newspaper interview he reflected: \"I\\'ve never really heard him whinge about anything.\"After the election Ian Cameron said he always thought David had the capability to be prime minister, but added unlike his son, he was not a politician. He spent his professional life as a stockbroker, and sat on parish and church councils.David Cameron said his father and mother - who worked as a magistrate -  \"wore their public service so lightly\".David Cameron said he almost gave up politics after his six-year-old son Ivan died last year. Last week the Camerons brought their new-born daughter Florence home to Downing Street. Ian Cameron did not see his grand-daughter before he died.Nick Robinson: Painful timesDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who stood in for Mr Cameron at the first PMQs after the summer recess, sent his thoughts and condolences to Mr Cameron\\'s family and said he was glad the PM was \"able to be at his father\\'s side at the end\".Chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: \"It\\'s a very difficult day for David Cameron and his family.\"I know David was very, very close to his father, and his father hasn\\'t been well over recent years, but he\\'s always been a really strong presence I know in David\\'s life, and I\\'m sure he\\'ll be missed by David and missed by all of us who knew him.\"BBC political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Cameron had often spoken of the close bond between him and his parents, who lived in Peasemore, Berkshire.Ian Cameron, 77, was born with both legs deformed, and endured repeated operations in an attempt to straighten them and ease his pain.Despite his disability he forged a successful career as a stockbroker and is a former director of estate agent John D Wood.The prime minister said before the general election that his father was a \"glass half-full\" person with a \"sense of optimism\".He told ITV 1\\'s Trevor McDonald: \"My father is a huge hero figure for me, because he\\'s an amazingly brave man....\"To have a disability in the 1930s and 1940s, a different age, was really tough, but  he never let it affect him in any way. \"Giles Andreae, a friend of Mr Cameron\\'s, told the BBC: \"David adored his father and his mother.

They could also be used to improve tools for minimally-invasive surgery.In one approach, Ali Javey at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues built up layers of criss-crossed nanometre-scale wires topped with a thin rubber sheet.Together, the stack acts as what is known as a thin-film transistor, or TFT, with a pressure-sensitive layer on top.The amount of electrical current running through the device is dependent upon how much pressure is exerted on the rubber sheet; more pressure allows more current to flow.The team demonstrated the flexibility of their TFT stacks by bending them to a radius smaller than that of a pencil without changing the skin\\'s performance.\"Javey\\'s work is a nice demonstration of their capability in making a large array of nanowire TFTs,\" said Zhenan Bao of Stanford University, whose group demonstrated the second approach.The heart of Professor Bao\\'s devices is micro-structured rubber sheet in the middle of the TFT - effectively re-creating the functionality of the Berkeley group\\'s skins with less layers.\"Instead of laminating a pressure-sensitive resistor array on top of a nanowire TFT array, we made our transistors to be pressure sensitive,\" Professor Bao explained to BBC News.\"Our microstructured rubber can bounce back to its original shape much faster and enable higher sensitivity,\" she added.The overall flexibility of the Stanford group\\'s skins appears to be lower, and Professor Bao concedes that to develop her group\\'s approach further, better conductive rubber will be needed.Nevertheless, both groups demonstrate that their skins can register a pressure in a tenth of a second, over a large range - from five grams per square centimetre to 40 times that high.Those numbers rival the response of human skin, made with relatively inexpensive manufacturing techniques.John Boland, a nanotechnologist from Trinity College Dublin, praised the two approaches in a critique for Nature Materials.\"Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of these studies is how they elegantly demonstrate that it is possible to exploit well-established processing technologies to engineer low-cost innovative solutions to important technical problems,\" he wrote.However, he notes that there are still \"significant opportunities for further innovation\", such as reducing the distance between the sensors in the arrays to maximise the detail they could \"feel\", as well as improvements that could make large-area arrays possible and affordable.\\n']\n",

Not so much an economic necessity as a political project driven by an ideological clamour for a minimal state.\"What they take apart now could take generations to rebuild. Decent public services are the glue that holds a civilised society together and we diminish them at our peril. Cut services, put jobs in peril and increase inequality, that\\'s the way to make Britain a darker, brutish, more frightening place.\"He said no-one took industrial action lightly, but added: \"Where members, faced with attacks on jobs, pay or pensions take a democratic decision for industrial action, they will have the support of unions and the TUC stands ready to co-ordinate that.\"BBC business reporter Simon Jack said no dates had been named for industrial action - but the motion meant unions were \"standing ready\" to do so if necessary, although there was no detail of what form it could take. He said the first co-ordinated action was not likely to take place until February or March 2011.By Ben WrightPolitical correspondent, BBC NewsMinisters have spent the summer softening the public up for cuts but, with big job losses looming, the unions haven\\'t been persuaded.Brendan Barber called the government\\'s assertions \"insulting claptrap\".Some trade union leaders, such as Bob Crow and Mark Serwotka, predict civil disobedience and coordinated strike action in response to cuts. But moderates like Mr Barber want to temper the tone and place the union movement at the centre of an alliance with the public, charities and community groups who oppose the cuts.So talk of a new winter of discontent may be wide of the mark, not least because secondary picketing is now illegal. But also because union leaders like Barber will be very wary about embarking on strike action that hits the users of public services hard and risks turning their members into villains.The government wants to sound moderate too, hence Francis Maude\\'s insistence he wants to see engagement and \"partnership\" between the unions and ministers. But confrontation looks likely so long as there\\'s a chasm between the Treasury and the unions on how to deal with the deficit.What is the Trades Union Congress?Only one delegate spoke against the motion, Jim McAuslan, general secretary of the airline pilots\\' union BALPA. He said it might be seen as an \"open goal\" for the government, and warned some union colleagues were \"getting the tone wrong\" in resisting every cut and they had to get the message out beyond unions to the wider community.Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers\\' (RMT) leader Bob Crow has called for a campaign of \"civil disobedience\" but Mr Barber told the BBC he thought that was \"counter-productive\".Instead he said he favoured \"a broad-based campaign... to look to harness public opinion behind the case for a different approach to managing our economy.\"He spoke against a purely critical campaign, asking unions to promote an \"alternative to austerity that encourages growth and jobs\".Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude told the BBC: \"We will listen very carefully to what they [the unions] say and the arguments that they make, there\\'s no question about that. We are not going back to the days where there\\'s a complete stand-off between the trade unions and the government. Those days are gone.\"But he said the coalition government had \"inherited a terrible budget deficit\" and was having to borrow £1 out of every £4 \"just to keep the lights on\".He said it was \"absolutely necessary\" to eradicate the budget deficit - to stop interest rates going up and \"choking off\" the recovery.He said the government wanted to protect front-line services and jobs and had spent months renegotiating with the government\\'s suppliers to cut costs, to try to protect as many jobs as possible.Downing Street also said the government wanted \"a genuine partnership with the trade unions\".The PM\\'s spokesman said. \"We need to deal with the deficit, we want to work with everyone in tackling that.\"For all the rhetoric of the union leaders, the BBC\\'s Political Editor Nick Robinson said it would be up to individual members whether to take strike action in ballots over the coming months.But he said there were growing indications of disquiet among council workers and police officers.Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison public services union, is calling for united action to defeat the government\\'s \"austerity agenda\".A special BBC News season examining the approaching cuts to public sector spendingThe Spending Review: Making It ClearUnite, the UK\\'s biggest union, says it wants a \"robust campaign\" to protect public services, while the GMB argues that three-quarters of a million jobs could be at risk.The RMT accuses ministers of launching \"all-out class warfare\".The government is not sending a minister to address the congress but Business Secretary Vince Cable has said he will be willing to speak to representatives to discuss their concerns.Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman addressed the TUC while the five candidates to become leader made their pitches to union delegates in the final hustings of the campaign.Each stressed their solidarity with the trade unions in the face of the anticipated spending squeeze but David Miliband said critics of the cuts needed to win the political arguments while brother Ed Miliband called for a \"responsible approach\" to opposition.The TUC congress is the curtain-raiser for the party conference season and will be followed over the next three weeks by events held by the Lib Dems, Labour and the Conservatives.\\n', 'Mr Cowen had to deny being drunk or hungover during the RTE interview.The taoiseach was interviewed live from his party\\'s conference, which is taking place in Galway.On Wednesday he said: \"I\\'m sorry that it emerged in the quality it did. There was a hoarseness in my voice throughout the day yesterday.\"He added: \"It wasn\\'t my best performance and I would like to apologise for that.\"I would hate to think the reputation of the country or the office of taoiseach would in any way be affected by what I had to say.\"Mr Cowen again denied any suggestions he was hungover.\"The assertions made subsequent to it were without justification, without foundation, were not correct, were not true,\" he said.Mr Cowen had attended the Fianna Fail party dinner at the Ardilaun Hotel in Galway on Monday night.Following the interview, the finance spokesman for the Republic\\'s opposition claimed there were concerns over the leadership of the country.\"There was a feeling this morning that this can\\'t continue, the game is up,\" said Fine Gael\\'s Michael Noonan.Simon Coveney, also of Fine Gael, who said in a Twitter message on Tuesday that Mr Cowen sounded \"half-way between drunk and hungover\" in the interview, has said he accepted the taoiseach\\'s apology.Mr Coveney said that he believed Mr Cowen, but added that he did not regret his previous tweet.He said it took \"a big person to apologise when big mistakes are made as was the case yesterday morning and the Taosieach should be recognised for that.\"\\n', 'And it\\'s tucked away for a very good reason.Inside, your senses are greeted by the smell of rotting dog food, the buzz of blowflies and the purple UV light of the fly killer ready to zap escapees.This is where the museum\\'s forensic entomologists breed different species of fly in a bid to help the police solve crimes.Museum scientist Amoret Whitaker is one of just three forensic entomologists in the UK who regularly works with the police to determine the time of death of a corpse.\"As soon as a person dies, their body starts to decompose and they give off specific odours. These different chemical signals are very very attractive to insects. And in the inital stages it\\'s especially blowflies.\"\"So when someone dies, fairly soon, it could be within minutes blowflies are attracted to the body and they will start laying eggs immediately. These will hatch into larvae or maggots and the developmental cycle will continue.\"\"You get a lot of male blowflies hanging around, sitting on plants around the body, waiting for suitable female mates.\"And it is this cycle of life and death that is critical in helping the police when they are uncertain of the timing of someone\\'s death.By understanding the \"succession\" rates or the speed of growth of flies, from an egg to the larval then adult stage she and her colleagues can determine the likely time that person died.But scientists only have developmental data on perhaps half of the twelve or so species of fly that are regulary found on dead bodies.By breeding them in \"captivity\" under different temperature conditions they can get more accurate information about the timing of their growth and so the process of death.The accuracy of that timing depends partly on how long the body has been decomposing. If she can get to see a corpse within days of its death,  when that person died can be worked out to an accuracy within hours.But, if the body has lain undiscovered for weeks, or even months, then the precision of timing can be narrowed to a matter of days.This timing can even be used to help determine whether a suspicious death should be treated as murder.\"In some cases of assault, if someone has been seen leaving a pub after a fight say, then that person is found dead a few days later, if we can determine when they died to a matter of hours, we can help establish whether the person died from the assault or other causes.\"The time of year can dramatically affect how a body decomposes. In one case Amoret and colleagues were involved in, a man disappeared in November but his body was not discovered until the following February.One pathologist report suggested the body had been dead for just a few weeks. In fact because he had died in winter his body had effectively been \"mummified\".The critical evidence came from Calliphora vicina, a bluebottle blowfly often found on dead bodies. C vicina grows all year round but in winter its development slows right down. While it remains alive, it becomes inactive at temperatures below 1C.This peculiarly slow rate of development meant Amoret and colleagues could prove the man had died months ago rather than weeks.The man had left a pub, taken a short-cut home then slipped and broken his neck.The police regularly use Amoret and her colleagues\\' expertise.\"We can go two months with nothing but then be asked to help with six cases in a couple of weeks.\"\"It\\'s rare that our evidence is used in court. It\\'s more common that we give police a time window and they can then gather further evidence.\"Forensic entomology can even be used in cases of burnt bodies, as insects may still be found, feeding within the body cavities. If a cadaver has been burnt this makes estimating time of death difficult for the pathologist.Between working with police in the UK and research at the Natural History Museum, Amoret also works at the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.There she compares the decomposition of dead pigs and human cadavers. Some people have nicknamed this place the \"body farm\".In the summers of 2008 and 2009 she compared the decomposition of three pigs and three human cadavers.Her research isn\\'t finalised but initial results are positive, confirming that pigs are a good model for how a human corpse decays.\"The same species of insects are attracted during the same time periods to both types of cadaver.  Large numbers of blowflies from days 1-5, fewer on days 6-7, and a large drop from day eight onwards,\" she told BBC News.She also says this research will be very useful for all cases where insect evidence is used.\"This work will have a big impact when it\\'s published, for forensic entomologists all over the world.  As it will show that pigs are a good model for humans, and therefore all the data gathered using pig cadavers can be applied to cases involving human cadavers.\"Amoret Whitaker is just one of the scientists demonstrating their research at the one night only event \"After Hours: Science Uncovered\" at the Natural History Museum on Friday 24th September between 1600 and 2200\\n', 'The animals, which include a leopard, two lynx and two ring-tailed lemurs, were found at Borth Animalarium, near Aberystwyth.Owners Alan and Jean Mumbray admitted not having the correct paperwork for a commercial premises in court on Monday.They were both fined and told the animals would be found new homes.Jean Mumbray was fined £937.50 and ordered to pay costs of £250, and Alan Mumbray was fined £300 and £100 costs at Aberystwyth Magistrates\\' Court, said Dyfed-Powys Police.Sgt Ian Guildford, a wildlife and environmental police officer with the force, said: \"The use of the licensing system to control the sale and display of protected animals is a valuable tool in the fight against the trade in endangered animals.\"Anyone who is involved in dealing with protected animals on a commercial scale such as zoos and other similar establishments should be aware of this and make every effort to comply with the legislation.\"Without this, compliance loopholes are left open to those who treat endangered animals as a financial commodity.\"Nevin Hunter, of the Animal Health Wildlife Licensing and Registration Service, said the prosecution was \"very significant\" and showed that illegal use of endangered animals would not be tolerated.He added: \"The vast majority of zoos and animal parks in the UK do so lawfully and play an important part in conserving endangered species.\"However, those who choose to flout the regulations are on notice that we will take decisive action with police wildlife crime officers to ensure that prosecutions are taken forward.\"I commend Sgt Ian Guildford, Dyfed-Powys Police, and the Crown Prosecution Service for taking forward the case and achieving this outcome.\"\\n', 'Mutations of the NR5A1 gene were found in a small percentage of infertile men, reports the American Journal of Human Genetics.Scientists from the Pasteur Institute in France and University College London said it could help doctors investigating men with the condition.A UK expert said he hoped that further gene defects could be found.In the majority of cases, doctors can find no cause for male infertility, despite it accounting for up to half of cases in which couples have difficulty conceiving.Male infertility appears to be more common within certain families, and this leads scientists to believe that there may be a genetic root for some cases, but only a handful of gene mutations which might be responsible have actually been found.The latest research looks at a gene already known to be involved in sexual development in both men and women - defects in NR5A1 have been linked to physical defects in the development of the testicles or ovaries.Their findings suggest that, even where there is no physical evidence of a problem, defects in the gene may be hampering the ability to make sperm.They looked at the gene in 315 apparently healthy men who had an unexplained inability to produce sperm.From this group, they found mutations in the gene in just seven, and closer examination revealed the men had altered levels of sex hormones and, in one case, mild abnormalities in the cellular structure of the testicles.The research authors, from the UCL Institute of Child Health in London and the Institut Pasteur in Paris, said: \"We conclude that approximately 4% of men with otherwise unexplained failure to produce sperm carry mutations in the NR5A1 gene.\"Although the find would affect only a small proportion of infertile men, other specialists believe that other similar discoveries could help build up a clearer picture of the origins of the condition.Dr Allan Pacey, a senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield, said that there was still \"embarrassingly little\" known about the genetics behind male infertility.\"Given the complexity of the sperm production process it is likely that many genes are involved and therefore that may gene defects linked to infertility may be found.\"Although this gene defect affects only a small number of men, we need more studies like this so that we can fill in the gaps in our knowledge and possibly one day build a robust diagnostic test for male fertility based on genetics.\"\\n', 'Staff at Breckland Council will not be paid in future for the time they take to have a cigarette after the proposals were given the go-ahead.Simon Clark, from Smokers\\' lobby group Forest, said earlier that everyone was entitled to a break during work.The council said the move was aimed at making the issue of smoke breaks fairer for individuals who did not smoke.William Nunn, leader of the Conservative-run council, said: \"We are not trying to stop smoking... what we are saying is when people go for a cigarette they should do it in their own time.\"Mr Clark said: \"Are they going to introduce clocking in and off for people who go on the internet, on Facebook, or people who want to have a cup of coffee?\"I am sure there are some smokers who abuse the situation and go out too often but if that is happening that is a failure of management.\"A meeting of the full council voted to approve the measure on Wednesday.\\n', 'The cash comes from chip maker Marvell which became a supporter and sponsor of OLPC in early 2009.The OLPC organisation said the grant meant it had all the development cash it needed to produce its next machine.OLPC said it would show off the first development work on the new machine at the CES show in January 2011.The cash handed over by Marvell will fund development of a tablet version of the XO - the rugged computer designed to boost education in developing nations.The device is code-named XO-3 as it will be the third device the OLPC organisation has produced.

He was heavily involved with the unions until he died aged 96 in April last year.Local historian, Danny Payne, said that although there were 27 names on the plaque, after further research it is believed that 30 people from Merseyside died fighting.They had to travel there in secret, after the UK government declared it illegal to fight in Spain as it tried to appease Hitler\\'s huge fascist force in the lead up to the Second World War.In total, 2,500 from across the British Isles fought in the Spanish Civil War and 500 did not survive.Mr Finegan said: \"The plaque used to be on the wall of the unemployed and trade union centre in Hardman Street, but since it closed years ago, it has been sent from place to place across the city.\"Now it\\'s good that it has a permanent home here, it all seems to fit together well - a newly refurbished building called Jack Jones and a memorial dedicated to those who lost their lives in the same war he fought.\"The civil war ended after WWII had started. More than 300,000 people died and the Republicans were persecuted by the victorious nationalist parties.Mr Payne added: \"It was an horrific war, Franco\\'s uprising was supported by the Hitler and Mussolini regimes so he was furnished with arms.\"The Republic was short of weapons and medical supplies and it was basically strangled by the might of Franco.\"\\n', 'The Dolomedes plantarius spiderlings were released into suitable dykes at Castle Marshes between Lowestoft and Beccles on Wednesday.About 4mm, they are hybrids between species found in Sussex and Suffolk.The 1,600 spiderlings were hand-reared in the kitchen of project leader Dr Helen Smith, with the surplus reared at the John Innes Centre in Norwich.Dr Smith said: \"The hybrids bring the advantage of increased genetic variability to the new population.\"This... should give the new population at Castle Marshes the best potential to adapt to its surroundings and to cope with the impacts of climate change.\"The project was organised by Natural England and Suffolk Wildlife Trust and was aided by a grant from the BBC Wildlife Fund.\\n', 'Mr Blunkett said using the same funding formula applied to Wales - which has a devolved budget - Yorkshire would be entitled to a Â£24bn budget.\"You put great store by devolving decision-making to ordinary people,\" he told Prime Minister David Cameron.Mr Cameron said the government had already got rid of a \"centralised\" approach that Mr Blunkett was part of.Mr Blunkett, a Labour former Cabinet minister and the MP for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, made the suggestion during prime minister\\'s questions in the House of Commons.He said: \"Can you think of one single reason why the people of Yorkshire shouldn\\'t determine their own priorities?\"And, mischievously, one reason why the people of Yorkshire shouldn\\'t have their own White Rose Parliament?\"Mr Cameron said: \"What we are doing is we are saying to councils in Yorkshire, as up and down the country, \\'We are getting rid of the ring fences, we are giving you the power to spend your money in the way that you choose\\'.\"He added: \"We have got rid of the bossy, centralised interfering approach that I\\'m afraid you were rather part of.\"\\n', 'Like 20 million other people in Bangladesh, most of them women, Ms Rani had turned to microcredit in an effort to lift herself out of poverty.Microfinance offers small loans to people who do not normally qualify for traditional banking credit, to encourage entrepreneurship.For many recipients it is a lifeline, and very often it is the only way for them to establish a business.But after the total destruction of their crops however, villagers like Joba are not in a position to repay their loans.Yet the microfinance organisations continue to collect the instalments.Microfinance is not without its critics. Some argue that people can quickly sink into a cycle of debt, with many lenders charging exorbitant rates of interest.Dr Qazi Kholikuzzaman Ahmad, chairman of PKSF, a body that monitors microfinance, describes microcredit as a \"death trap\" for the poor.He explains how poor people often take up the loans without thinking of the consequences, and that 60% of borrowers take loans from several sources.\"There is no understanding that it might take 10 or 20 years to repay their loan,\" he says.Furthermore, from the weekly repayments, some lenders deduct 10% of that payment for compulsory saving schemes - money the company then uses to lend to other people.\"Interest on repayments begin at around 15%, but it is a flat rate and can soon rise to anything between 40% and 100%,\" Dr Ahmad says.Repayments are generally due on loans from the first week after they are taken out, which does not give the borrower enough time to establish any form of income-earning enterprise.To cover those first payments, people often resort to taking out a further loan from a different company.Ms Rani used her loan to buy six cows but after her crops were destroyed she had to sell three of them, at half the market price, to enable her to repay her loan.\"I was hoping to save the remaining cows but they had to be sold as well,\" she laments.Women are the main borrowers in the village and they were attracted to microcredit because they could get the loans easily and quickly.Money is not always used as capital investment. Many people borrow money for cultivation, buying cattle, or a flock of chicks or ducklings.Villagers are sending their children to work to help them make the repayments.Source: Microfinance Information Exchange 2009But when they are still unable to pay enough, the debt collectors insist that they sell their cattle, chickens and other household items.Selling agricultural land is also considered as a last desperate option.Villagers complain of harassment from the debt collectors and there have been allegations of physical assaults.Because field officers are judged on repayment rates, they sometimes use coercive and even violent tactics to collect instalments on the microcredit loans.Many villagers finally turn to local usurers - the very people whom Professor Yunus tried put out of business when he made his first loan of $27 (Â£17) to a group of families in a village in 1976.Professor Yunus and his Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microfinance and he refers to many of the institutions which have followed his example as \"the new loan sharks.\"His organisation has a policy whereby loans are rescheduled in times of natural disaster.Relief costsAfter the floods in Bangladesh, the district administrations requested microfinance organisations to stop collecting instalments for the time being.But that call has gone unheeded.Dr Ahmad is dismayed.\"There are some agencies which even take their payments from relief material,\" he says.\\n', 'They found that targeting a part of the brain called the parietal lobe improved the ability of volunteers to solve numerical problems.They hope the discovery could help people with dyscalculia, who may struggle with numbers.Another expert said effects on other brain functions would need checking.The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology.Some studies have suggested that up to one in five people have trouble with maths, affecting not just their ability to complete problems but also to manage everyday activities such as telling the time and managing money.Neuroscientists believe that activity within the parietal lobe plays a crucial role in this ability, or the lack of it.When magnetic fields were used in earlier research to disrupt electrical activity in this part of the brain, previously numerate volunteers temporarily developed discalculia, finding it much harder to solve maths problems.The latest research goes a step further, using a one milliamp current to stimulate the parietal lobe of a small number of students.The current could not be felt, and had no measurable effect on other brain functions.As it was turned on, the volunteers tried to learn a puzzle which involved substituting numbers for symbols.Those given the current from right to left across the parietal lobe did significantly better when given, compared to those who were given no electrical stimulation.The direction of the current was important - those given stimulation running in the opposite direction, left to right, did markedly worse at these puzzles than those given no current, with their ability matching that of an average six-year-old.The effects were not short-lived, either. When the volunteers whose performance improved was re-tested six months later, the benefits appear to have persisted.There was no wider effect on general maths ability in either group, just on the ability to complete the puzzles learned as the current was applied.Dr Cohen Kadosh, who led the study, said: \"We are not advising people to go around giving themselves electric shocks, but we are extremely excited by the potential of our findings and are now looking into the underlying brain changes.\"We\\'ve shown before that we can induce dyscalculia, and now it seems we might be able to make someone better at maths, so we really want to see if we can help people with dyscalculia.By Fergus WalshMedical correspondent, BBC NewsRead more in Fergus\\'s blog\"Electrical stimulation is unlikely to turn you into the next Einstein, but if we\\'re lucky it might be able to help some people to cope better with maths.\"Dr Christopher Chambers, from the School of Psychology at Cardiff University, said that the results were \"intriguing\", and offered the prospect not just of improving numerical skills, but having an impact on a wider range of conditions.He said: \"The ability to tweak activity in parts of the brain, turning it slightly \\'up\\' or \\'down\\' at will, opens the door to treating a range of psychiatric and neurological problems, like compulsive gambling or visual impairments following stroke.\"However, he said that the study did not prove that the learning of maths skills was improved, just that the volunteers were better at linking arbitrary numbers and symbols, and he warned that researchers needed to make sure other parts of the brain were unaffected.\"This is still an exciting new piece of research, but if we don\\'t know how selective the effects of brain stimulation are then we don\\'t know what other brain systems could also be affected, either positively or negatively.\"Sue Flohr, from the British Dyslexia Association, which also provides support for people with dyscalculia, said the research was welcome.She said: \"It\\'s certainly an under-recognised condition, but it can ruin lives.\"It makes it very hard to do everyday things like shopping or budgeting - you can go into a shop and find you\\'ve spent your month\\'s money without realising it.\"\\n', 'Fifty-nine people had died up until and including Thursday, and 617 others had been infected, bringing the total affected to 7,359, the ministry added.The news came as the local authorities and relief agencies attempted to get clean drinking water to those areas worse affected by Hurricane Tomas.The storm caused flooding and left eight people dead in western Haiti.The charity, Save the Children, said that in Leogane, the streets had been turned into \"rivers\" and some 35,000 people had been affected.By Laura TrevelyanBBC News, LeoganeThe UN estimates 15,000 people in Leogane have been affected by the floods.Amercie lost her home when January\\'s earthquake flattened this small town west of Port Au Prince. And now her tent has been flooded because the river burst its banks.The mother-of-three is sitting opposite Leogane\\'s cemetery, where family tombs lie on their sides, cracked in two by the quake, now surrounded by water.Amercie is worried the combination of dead bodies and stagnant water from the flooding could spread the cholera outbreak to here, where so far no cases have been reported.Next to Amercie, Jean Pierre, a farmer who just planted what he hoped would be a new crop of banana trees and yams, says the flood has washed away his plantation.His childhood home collapsed in January\\'s quake; the house he built afterwards has just flooded.

The market is open, and the merchants are selling fruit and vegetables, trying to make a living as best they can.The BBC\\'s Laura Trevelyan in the town said the water reached her knees, and that people were afraid of the risk of disease.There was also flooding in Les Cayes, Jacmel and Gonaives, while many mountain towns have been cut off by flooded roads and landslides.There was widespread relief on Friday after Hurricane Tomas passed without destroying the tented camps in and around the capital, Port-au-Prince, housing about 1.3 million survivors of January\\'s earthquake.However, attention soon turned to preventing the spread of cholera, which is caused by bacteria transmitted through contaminated water or food, in the unsanitary conditions.Cholera causes diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to severe dehydration, but can kill quickly. It is treated easily through rehydration and antibiotics.A spokesman for the Pan-American Health Organisation, Christian Lindmeier, told the Reuters news agency: \"Cholera is a water-borne disease and so additional water means additional risk.\"\"We do expect the infection rate to jump up due to the flooding and to the bad sanitation conditions in many areas,\" he said.In the town of Saint Marc, in the northern region where the outbreak began three weeks ago, a Cuban doctor in charge of the local hospital said there had been more cases of cholera since the hurricane.BBC Health: CholeraCholera \\'difficult to predict\\'\"The situation here - after the storm - has worsened,\" Dr Buenaventura Sanchez told the Associated Press.\"We are seeing higher numbers [of cases] than in the days before, and we are also seeing cases of cholera with typhoid fever at the same time.\"Like cholera, typhoid is caught by consuming contaminated food or drink that has been handled by an infected person, or if contaminated sewage gets into water used for drinking or washing food. It can also be fatal if not treated.Gary Shaye, the country director of Save the Children, said thousands of children in Leogane were now at increased risk of diarrhoeal diseases.On Friday, Haiti\\'s government and the United Nations appealed to donors for nearly $19m to cover urgent humanitarian needs.\\n']\n",

He is just a hero.\"Abebe Abebaw said he was a model for the country, while another Addis Ababa resident Walelgn Tamir recalled how he had been at the forefront of Ethiopia\\'s long-distance running rivalry with neighbouring Kenya.But he recognised that Gebrselassie\\'s career could not go on for ever.\"He is getting old, older and older, so it is getting difficult after this time for him because of age,\" he said.Haile Gebrselassie, 37, leaves the sport he dominated for the last two decades with a string of records.But he has also made a name for himself outside the sporting world, as a businessman, educator, philanthropist and art collector.He and his wife, Alem, have three daughters and one son. He told a local magazine last year that he would like his children to become runners, to achieve more than he has and to make their own names.The couple also own a construction business and built the country\\'s first private cinema, which shows only Ethiopian films. Alem Cinema is in the same building that houses the gym where he trains, Alem Fitness Centre.He has built and owns two schools, and his resort in the southern tourist town of Hawassa opened earlier this year.Gebrselassie\\'s influence even stretches into politics. He is one of the Elders, a group of Ethiopians who have mediated in political crises in the country since 2005.The Elders helped negotiate the release of the people imprisoned in the aftermath of the bitterly-disputed 2005 parliamentary election.They also helped broker the pardon and release last month of the opposition leader, Birtukan Mideksa. Gebrselassie apparently allowed Ms Birtukan to recuperate at his resort, free of charge, with her mother and young daughter.He is aware that his achievements in sports have made him an international legend, and told me last year that he would use that platform to make a difference in the world.And so, beyond national politics, Gebrselassie is involved in international campaigns against climate change and malaria.He feels strongly that athletes must be taught to manage their finances, and spent one week last November training with and mentoring young runners.Ten years ago, he founded the Great Ethiopian Run, which has since become known as Africa\\'s biggest road race.The contest is open to amateur and professional runners and is recognised as a show of talent from the continent\\'s next generation of runners.So beloved is Gebrselassie in Ethiopia that in 2001, the country\\'s best known musician Tedi Afro composed a song in his honour and with his name.Given his status both nationally and beyond, there are some who believe that Gebrselassie may not have finished running - but that his next race may well be a political one.\\n', \"As no single party or bloc commands a majority of the 325 seats in parliament, the contenders have had to forge new partnerships and deals in their efforts to share out the positions of power.This is the main Shia parliamentary bloc. It was formed after the March 2010 elections as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance (INA).The National Alliance decided in October to support Mr Maliki's bid for a second term as premier, but the decision was reportedly not unanimous.STATE OF LAW COALITION: This grouping - which merged with the Iraqi National Alliance to form the National Alliance - is led by outgoing Prime Minister Maliki, who has been seeking a second term in power.The bloc purportedly cut across religious and tribal lines. It included Mr Maliki's Shia Islamist Dawa [Call] Party as well as some Sunni tribal leaders, Shia Kurds, Christians and independents.Mr Maliki said the alliance wanted an Iraq built on nationalist principles.However, many of the minority Sunnis apparently aren't confident that he truly believes they should be given a large share of power.Mr Maliki hoped to capitalise on successes of his first term in office. However, his record on security was undermined by a series of high-profile attacks on government targets in Baghdad before the March elections.IRAQI NATIONAL ALLIANCE (INA): This mainly Shia alliance - which merged with the State of Law Coalition - includes followers of the powerful cleric and one-time militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr.It brings together the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council (IISC), the Basra-based Fadhilah party, a few Sunni leaders, former prime minister Ibrahim Jaafari, and Ahmad Chalabi - the former exile who played a key role before the 2003 US-led invasion.Jaafari was prime minister in the Iraqi Transitional Government between 2005 and 2006 and his reputation was tainted by the fact that militias took over the security services while he was in charge, and by the sectarian war that ensued.A senior leader of the IISC is outgoing Vice-President Adel Abdul-Mahdi.The Kurdish coalition is dominated by the two parties administering Iraq's northern, semi-autonomous Kurdish region.The Kurdistan Democratic Party led by the region's president, Masood Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Iraq's outgoing national president, Jalal Talabani, are both secular in nature and enjoy close ties with the West.The two parties faced a major challenge in Kurdistan's parliamentary vote this year from the Reform (Change) bloc, which won about a quarter of the seats.The Kurds have played king-maker in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and will likely retain enough clout to be part of a ruling alliance with another faction.This alliance won the election by a slim two-seat margin over outgoing Prime Minister Maliki's State of Law, but neither came anywhere near the majority needed to govern.It is led by former prime minister Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis who view him as a strongman capable of countering Shia power Iran.The alliance includes outgoing Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni Arab, and senior Sunni politician Saleh al-Mutlaq. They ran on a nationalist platform.While all of the major coalitions have adopted a rhetoric of ''national unity'', al-Iraqiyya, and Saleh al-Mutlaq in particular, have a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of their rivals.This group brings together a range of significant political figures, including Interior Minister Jawad Bolani and a leader of the Sunni anti-al-Qaeda militia in al-Anbar province, Ahmad Abu-Risha.Unity of Iraq has adopted a similar rhetoric to Mr Maliki's State of Law list, probably prompting suggestions that key figures in the list, such as Abu-Risha, appeared to have been seriously considering joining Mr Maliki.Like al-Iraqiyya, the Unity of Iraq list was seriously affected by the ban on candidates with alleged Baathist links.The Iraqi Accord Front, an alliance of parties led by Sunni politicians, participated in the December 2005 elections but has since been weakened by splits and defections. It includes Speaker of the last parliament, Ayad al-Samarrai.It consists of some tribal leaders and the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), which has increased its political visibility over recent years, enhancing its claim to represent Iraqi Sunnis at a national level.Tribal leaders were courted by major parties as it was thought they would play an important role in the election. Some of Iraq's Sunni tribal leaders sprang to prominence when US forces began backing local sheikhs against al-Qaeda in 2006.While the tribal figures are looking to branch out into mainstream politics, they have not formed a united front and have mainly joined forces with existing blocs.Smaller minorities, including Turkmen, Christians, Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans, Shabak and others, were thought likely to ally with bigger electoral lists in areas where they were not dominant.BBC Monitoring selects and translates news from radio, television, press, news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages.

But if we forget that the town\\'s name comes from Beddau, the Welsh for graves, then we\\'d be losing an understanding of its possible roots as an ancient, pre-Christian burial site.\"But whilst the true meaning of Beddau\\'s name is not fully understood, many other historical, socio-economic, and environmental riddles have been solved through the study of how our ancestors named their lands.Through the name of Dôl-y-Pennau in Snowdonia ( which translates into \"Meadow of Heads\"), members of the Llên Natur project were able to point archaeologists to the previously-undiscovered site of a massacre between feuding Welsh princes, which resulted in dozens of people being beheaded before their heads were discarded in a field in the area named in their memory.A study of a concentration in eastern Wales, of places bearing the suffix \\'Wern\\' or \\'Gwern\\' has similarly lent fresh understanding to the trade links between medieval Wales and the Norman Marcher states.Gwern derives from the Welsh for alder tree, the willow-like wood from which was used to manufacture clogs for agricultural workers.While the trees are native throughout Wales, the frequency of Wern and Gwern in the east of the country pointed historians towards studying potential sites where they may have been grown on a commercial basis, for sale to agricultural areas over the border in Herefordshire and Shropshire.But not all the discoveries are of a purely historical nature.The pine marten, a small mammal once native to Wales, is now facing extinction.However, the number of places which include \\'bela\\' - Welsh for pine marten - in their name is testament to the frequency with which they were once found here.Conservationists are using these places as a starting point to study satellite imagery for potential sites where pine martens may one day be re-introduced into the wild.This weekend\\'s conference is the culmination of years of work by Duncan Brown, a Welsh-speaker whose work for the Countryside Council for Wales led to his fascination with the links between  language and environment.But he warned: \"It\\'s sometimes dangerous to read too much into place names, or to take them too literally.\"\"For example, places with \\'eos\\' suffixes derive from the Welsh for nightingale.  They\\'re no longer native to Wales, and there\\'s some debate whether they ever were.\"Yet there are two clusters of \\'eos\\' names in Wales, one around Carmarthenshire and Glamorganshire, and another in the north, centred around Denbighshire  and northern Powys.\"\"The south Wales group are prefixed with terms like \\'llwyn\\', a copse, or \\'y-pant\\' , a hollow, which correspond with the natural habitat of nightingales.\"\"However, the group in the north have prefixes like \\'llety\\'r\\', from the Welsh for a tavern or inn.\"So the reference to nightingale is far more likely to have originated from someone who sung there, with the voice of a nightingale.\"Message of importanceThe Llên Natur conference is being opened with an address by Culture Minister Alun Ffred Jones.Mr Brown is hoping this will prove indicative of more concrete support for the project.\"It\\'s fantastic to have Alun Ffred along to speak anyway, as it\\'s a real recognition of the hard work everyone has put in,\" he said.\"Everyone knows that there\\'s not much money to go around at the moment, but inexpensive things could make a big difference.\"\"We\\'ve already made a huge start on a database of place-names and their origins on the Llên Natur website, and with access to support from the assembly (government) we could go even further.\"\"Also, some within the group would like to see legislation brought before the assembly to prevent historic Welsh place names becoming anglicised or changed altogether to ones with no local significance.\"\"Even if the resources weren\\'t available to police it rigorously, the simple presence of legislation would send out a message of the importance that Welsh place names continue to have to this day.\"\\n', 'The 80ft (24.3m) structure will be located on a raised part of the seafront in Redcar, at the site of the former Leos night club.It will have a viewing platform, a studio, galleries and a cafe.Work is due to start on the town\\'s sea defences in early 2011, and the construction of the vertical pier is set to begin in the autumn.Councillor Sheelagh Clarke, cabinet member for culture, leisure and tourism, said: \"The public told us that they wanted to see unique attractions in Redcar that do not replicate those of other resorts.\"The vertical pier will create a point of interest to attract people to Redcar and re-ignite interest in the town as a place to visit.\"\\n', 'More than 100 people are still missing and feared dead after a hillside collapsed on Sunday, following the heaviest rains in the country for decades.Local residents initially used their bare hands to dig into tonnes of mud that engulfed some 30 houses. Seven people have been saved so far.Thousands of people have fled the area.The BBC\\'s Jeremy McDermott in Medellin says many of the bodies being pulled from the mud are those of children who were playing in the streets when the landslide hit.The scar of the collapsed hillside can be seen from miles away, he adds.The landslide hit the La Gabriela district of Bello, Antioquia province, at about 1900 GMT on Sunday.In pictures: Colombia landslideOfficials originally feared that 145 people may have been buried.But the mayor of Bello, Oscar Andres Perez, told Colombian radio 123 people had been trapped.He said the hill had become increasingly saturated with water over the past few days and that there had been a \"high risk of landslides\".Mr Perez said the authorities had warned residents of the danger.Orfanely Madrigal, a Bello resident, told a local radio station she had been aware of the risk: \"I foresaw this tragedy. I told my mother this was a high-risk area but nobody believed me.\"\"I\\'ve lost half my family - my mother, four brothers, nephews and my 13- and 10-year-old daughters,\" she said.Several hundred people, including Red Cross rescue workers, soldiers and police, are digging through the deep mud in an effort to find survivors. More than 20 sniffer dogs have also been brought in.However, teams are moving cautiously for fear that heavy machinery will crush homes buried in the mud.Red Cross officials say that 174 people have died as a result of the heavy rains in Colombia, 225 have been injured and 19 are missing, without counting the victims of the Bello landslide.Tens of thousands have been left homeless after most major rivers have burst their banks as a result of the heavy rain.Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has announced he is flying to Bello to personally assess the situation there.Mr Santos has said recovering from the torrential rains and the damage they have caused is going to be very expensive, and that he is considering calling a national state of emergency if the rains continue.\"Unfortunately, this tragedy has just kept growing,\" he said.Neighbouring Venezuela is also experiencing heavy flooding.Some 70,000 people have been driven from their homes there.President Hugo Chavez has said his government plans to seize private land to house some of those forced to abandon their homes.The May-November rainy season in Mexico, Central America and the northern part of South America has been severe this year.The extreme weather is attributed to the La Nina climatic phenomenon, which is caused by colder than usual water currents along the Pacific coast.\\n', 'Scientists agree that such attacks are extremely rare - and that sharks are not the man-eaters depicted in Hollywood blockbusters such as Jaws.But they will try to determine why the sharks were lured into shallow waters, and what prompted them to carry out a series of attacks that left one person dead and several more injured.So far, two sharks - an oceanic white tip and a mako shark - have been caught by local fishermen, but experts say there is no evidence so far that either of them are responsible for the attacks.There is an abundance of oceanic white tip sharks - Carcharhinus longimanus - in the Red Sea. Divers have spoken of diving with oceanic white tips without feeling threatened.Sources: International Union for Conservation of Nature and International Shark Attack FilesBut Ian Fergusson, a shark biologist and patron of the Shark Trust, a UK conservation organisation, said the presence of the short-fin mako shark was intriguing.Oceanic white tips frequent the region but it was unusual for swimmers to encounter them in shallow waters, he said, and it was very rare for shortfin makos to be found in the Red Sea - and exceptionally rare to find them close to shore.He said the last time a short-fin mako attacked in the area was in 1970s, when a tourist was wounded in an attack off Eilat\\'s reefs.Mr Fergusson, a regular visitor to the area, said it would not be difficult for a shark to get close to the shore in Sharm el-Sheikh.\"That particular part of the coastline is bordering on deep water. You don\\'t have to go far offshore to find yourself in 500 metres of water. Sharks can get within half a mile of the shore easily. They don\\'t, for example, have to cross reefs to get there.\"According to the University of Florida\\'s International Shark Attack Files, there are an estimated 70-100 shark attacks on humans per year, resulting in about five to 15 deaths. Of those, the oceanic white tip is responsible for only a small number.But the large oceanic sharks were also the main culprits behind countless attacks on sailors and airmen who, after air and sea battles, found themselves adrift in the Pacific during World War II.So what could have prompted the latest attacks?There has been speculation that animal carcasses were recently dumped into the Red Sea, not far off the shore. Some reports have suggested the remains could have been thrown overboard by a ship carrying animal cargo.\"If you start dumping carcasses, you couldn\\'t ask for a better way of baiting for sharks,\" said Mr Fergusson.David Jacoby, who specialises in shark behavioural ecology at The Marine Biological Association of the UK, agreed that if this is the case, it was likely to be a significant factor in the sharks\\' behaviour.\"Pelagic, or oceanic, species of shark often feed opportunistically because the open ocean can be a sparse environment for food,\" he said.While less is known about the movements and behaviour of the oceanic white tip, compared with some other species, Mr Jacoby offered another possible explanation as to why the sharks might have been in shallow water.Based on evidence, experts know that in other shark species, larger females move into warmer, shallow waters to either aid gestation - which can be between 9-12 months in white tips depending on the temperature - or to pup, although from what little evidence there is, it seems that oceanic white tips probably pup in the early summer.\"Both species [white tips and makos] rarely encounter people as they spend large amounts of their time in blue water - open ocean,\" said Mr Jacoby.\"Like other species, the oceanic white tip is opportunistic and can be fairly aggressive. It is hard to speculate why they attack but they might if they felt they were threatened.\"They are not coming specifically to attack humans - they are not seen as a food source. But if a white tip or mako felt threatened, felt cornered by lots of people in the water, or next to a reef, for example, it might display more aggressive behaviour as a defence mechanism.\"They are opportunistic and it could just be a case of people being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"Or, he said, they could be cases of mistaken identity - the shark misinterpreting a human for its normal prey.Mr Jacoby said shiny objects in the water could attract attention from sharks - so if the sharks were already in the area, shiny jewellery might be a trigger.There has also been speculation that sharks could have have moved to shallow water because of the depletion of local food sources in the area, but Mr Jacoby disagrees with this.\"This would surely have the opposite effect,\" he said.He explains that sharks adopt search behaviour aiming to maximise their encounters with food sources. Therefore, there is likely to be a relationship between natural prey distributions - fish, squid etc - and shark distributions, as the sharks generally try and go where the food is.However, if a potential food source such as carcasses have been discarded close to shore, some sharks would naturally pick up on this and opportunistically feed there. This would increase the numbers of sharks in the area, making interactions with people more likely.In the past, shark attacks on snorkellers have been blamed on shoddy diving practices such as \"chumming\" - attracting sharks by throwing solid bait or pouring chum, a mash of fish oil and blood, into the water.This type of activity aims to attract sharks such as oceanic white tips, which tend to stay out in the ocean.But Mr Fergusson said he didn\\'t \"buy\" this theory.\"Recent studies in South Africa have shown that chumming has limited effect on shark behaviour.\"This is partly because these sharks are such migratory species, and mainly because this is a Marine National Park, any feeding is prohibited - anyone found doing it would be arrested and jailed.\"He said a more compelling argument could be a continued decline in pelagic fish stocks having an impact on the natural foraging behaviour of certain shark species.While any degradation to the ecosystem of the local reef wouldn\\'t necessarily affect the oceanic white tip because this is outside of its natural habitat, Mr Fergusson said this could \"point to a larger issue of general offshore fishing of tuna and other big fish whittling down and influencing the food chain\".In Egypt, the hunt is still on for the shark that carried out the latest, fatal attack.Mark Murphy, who runs a scuba diving holiday firm in London, told the BBC that the local authorities would probably aim to have a \"quick clean-up of the area\".\"There are over four million visitors a year to the Red Sea and there hasn\\'t been a single incident within the last five years,\" said Mr Murphy.\"I am saddened that the Egyptian government has decided to slaughter sharks indiscriminately. Over 70 million sharks a year are killed by humans and they are an essential part of the marine ecosystem.\"In any case, according to US-based shark expert Samuel Gruber, finding the predator or predators would be extremely difficult.\\n', 'Figures from the Association of Public Health Observatories reveal the UK is the fattest EU member and has one of the highest rates of teen pregnancies.The UK also performs badly on female cancer survival and infant deaths.But life expectancy figures in the UK are slightly better than for EU counterparts and the nation also excels at treating heart disease.And our early action on smoking has had a very positive impact on health outcomes, the report authors say.They compared all regions across 27 countries in Europe using 37 health indicators in 2006.The UK as a whole scored particularly badly on obesity, being the fattest nation of all.And within the UK it was the West Midlands that had the highest percentage of obese adults at 29% - double the EU average of 14% and much higher than the 19% rate seen in Greater London.The UK\\'s female death rates from cancer were also among the worst in Europe.Deaths in south-east England were the highest at 185 per 100,000, followed by Scotland at 179 per 100,000 and north-east England at 174. This compares with the European average of 139.5 per 100,000.All parts of the UK had more teenage mothers than in most other European countries - but the North East of England came out the worst.The researchers acknowledge the picture may have changed slightly since the data was collected, but they say their snapshot should be a warning to public health experts.Dr Claire Bradford and Professor John Wilkinson, who compiled the report, said the information could help the UK improve its track record.Dr Bradford said: \"This type of data allows us to compare not just between countries but within countries and to look at what is going well and what is not.\"People that are able to influence which way we are going as a nation should look at this to decide on priorities and actions.\"Our problem with obesity might be a good place to start.\"Commenting on the data, public health expert, Professor Sir Michael Marmot said the report highlighted \"stark differences\" in health across the EU.\"The causes of health inequalities are socially determined,\" he said.\"The behaviours that lead to obesity and teenage pregnancy, for example, arise from social conditions.\"This knowledge informs what we as a society can do at a local, regional, national and international level to create the conditions for greater health equity.\"Professor Steve Field of the Royal College of General Practitioners said: \"I\\'m appalled by the figures and feel ashamed as a GP working in the West Midlands that this area has the highest percentage of obese adults in Europe.\"Obesity is a major problem and predictor of ill health throughout a patient\\'s life, causing serious illnesses.\"I hope we will be able to do more in the future to get people to take responsibility for their own health and take more exercise and eat sensibly.\"A Department of Health spokesman said: \"The government has made it clear that tackling health inequalities is a priority as part of its commitment to fairness and social justice.\"Action to tackle health inequalities is at the centre of our approach to public health.\"We will aim to use the least intrusive approach necessary to achieve the desired effect.\"We will seek to use approaches that focus on enabling and guiding people\\'s choices wherever possible.\"\\n', 'The Strategic Defence and Security Review in October revealed HMS Ocean or aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious would be scrapped.Mr Fox said HMS Illustrious would be withdrawn in 2014.A Ministry of Defence study said amphibious assault ship HMS Ocean was the most effective helicopter platform.A ministerial statement said HMS Illustrious would be withdrawn from service once HMS Ocean had been refitted.Four Devonport-based frigates, HMS Chatham, Campbeltown, Cumberland and Cornwall will be withdrawn in 2011.Chatham will be withdrawn from service at the end of January and Campbeltown and Cumberland will follow on 1 April.HMS Cornwall will be withdrawn at the end of April once it has returned from a deployment to the Indian Ocean.HMS Ocean, built in the mid 1990s, is designed to support amphibious landing operations.Its secondary roles include training, anti-submarine warfare and a base for anti-terrorist operations.\\n', 'The city council has proposed that owners face harsher fines for dog fouling and is asking the public to take part in a consultation.Dogs could be banned from play areas in parks and owners set limits on the number of dogs they take for walks in public.Authorised officers would also have the power to request dogs be put on a lead.Councillor John Tanner, board member for the Cleaner Greener Oxford campaign, said: \"There is nothing more annoying than getting dog mess on your shoe or in the wheels of the pushchair.\"Oxford City Council wants to get tough with irresponsible dog owners.\"The consultation runs until 31 January and a report is presented to the city\\'s executive board in March.If approved, the new dog control orders would come into effect on 1 April.\\n', 'Seven organisations have issued joint advice on vitamin D, which the body gets from natural sunlight.The nutrient keeps bones strong, and protects against conditions like osteoporosis.The guidance was drawn up because it is thought fears about skin cancer have made people too cautious about being in the sun.Cancer Research UK and the National Osteoporosis Society are among the bodies which agree that \"little and frequent\" spells in summer sunshine several times a week can benefit your health.The experts now say it is fine to go outside in strong sun in the middle of the day, as long as you cover up or apply sunscreen before your skin goes red.Professor Rona Mackie, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said: \"Total sun protection with high factor suncream on all the time is not ideal, in terms of vitamin D levels.\"Even Australia has changed its policy on this. They\\'re now producing charts showing parts of Australia where sun protection may not be required during some parts of the year.\"Some of the messages about sun exposure have been too negative. UK summer sunshine isn\\'t desperately strong. We don\\'t have many days in the year when it is very intense.\"What\\'s changed is that we\\'re now saying that exposure of 10 to 15 minutes to the UK summer sun, without suncream, several times a week is probably a safe balance between adequate vitamin D levels and any risk of skin cancer.\"Official government advice already recommends vitamin D supplements for pregnant women and children aged under five.But the experts who wrote the joint statement say mothers often are not made aware of this recommendation. They suggest women consult their GP.Winter levels of vitamin D can be helped by a break in the tropical sun - or by eating oily fish, liver and fortified margarine.Cancer Research UK\\'s chief clinician, Professor Peter Johnson, said: \"A good diet and sensible sun exposure will be adequate for the great majority of the UK population to minimise their cancer risk.\"The area of vitamin D and cancer is complex.\"There\\'s some evidence, which is strongest in bowel cancer, that low levels of vitamin D in the blood correlate with the risk of developing cancer.\"But that doesn\\'t mean those low levels cause bowel cancer.\"We think overall that low levels of vitamin D are unlikely to be major contributors to the chances of developing cancer in the UK population.\"The joint statement also highlighted questions about vitamin D that warrant further research.These include finding out the optimal levels of vitamin D, and more detail about the role of dietary sources and supplements.\\n', 'The ad - part of a government-funded anti violence campaign - holds a special significance at the time when many worry that an overflow of Mexico\\'s drug violence could soon hit this small Central American nation.The first one to raise the alert was President Mauricio Funes himself, last April.\"We have information that they [the cartels] have entered El Salvador with exploratory purposes,\" President Funes said.Because of what he described as the \"effectiveness\" of Mexican President Felipe Calderon\\'s policies, the cartels were looking at new bases for their operations, he added.Since then, security forces have been watching closely to see if criminal organisations like the Zetas - one of Mexico\\'s most violent cartels - are deploying in Salvadorean territory.The cartels\\' possible collusion - or confrontation - with local gangs is also being monitored.Douglas Garcia Funes from the Salvadorean national police says intelligence suggests that gang members are already \"being used by or are operatives for the transport of drugs and money towards the United States, passing through Mexico\".In a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world, this is a sobering scenario.It could bring more chaos to an already violent country, many Salvadoreans say - and the government seems to be bracing for the worst.\"We are certainly worried, and that is why we want to act in a preventive manner,\" Hugo Martinez, El Salvador\\'s foreign minister, told BBC News.In pictures: Life inside an El Salvador jailThe presence of the gangs known as \"maras\", born among Salvadorean migrants in Los Angeles in the 1980s, is believed to be the largest contributor to those soaring rates.Some estimates say that about 15,000 young men and women belong to one of the gangs. In some families, a third generation of gang members is now developing.The maras have strong territorial control in some areas of the country and practice what they call \"social cleansing\" - they wipe out petty crime, but ask for money from locals in exchange for protection, and engage in widespread criminal activity.A retired gang member, who prefers not to be named, says that belonging to a \"mara\" gives young, poor Salvadoreans a sense of vindication against the larger society.\"People are scared, are afraid of what a gang member can do, like stealing or killing,\" he says.\"That is what being part of a \\'mara\\' is about.\"The maras are not new to El Salvador, but an incident in June marked a turning point.Gang members set fire to a small bus in the capital, killing 17 people. The government branded it a \"terrorist act\".Soon afterwards, the government proposed a tough \"anti-mara\" bill that makes it a criminal offence to belong to a gang or contribute to gang finances by paying extortion fees.In addition, more than 6,000 soldiers - almost half of the army\\'s manpower - have been deployed in hotspots around the country including border crossings, jails and areas with a strong \"mara\" presence.This tougher stance was seen by many as preparation for the threat of Mexican cartels moving in to El Salvador.The person who knows most about violence in El Salvador may well be Israel Ticas, a forensic investigator from the security ministry.He is the sole official in charge of the exhumation of bodies buried in clandestine graveyards by the gangs.He has already unearthed more than 38 of these graves around the country - and he believes there are dozens more still to be found.The walls of his office in the capital are covered with pictures of the bodies, many of them too hard to digest for a casual observer.They show men and women tortured, beheaded, mutilated; the violence seems to reach unimaginable levels.And, says Mr Ticas, the cruelty is only getting worse.\"In the last few years, the gangs have become more sophisticated\" in the way they bury their victims, he says.\"They hide [the bodies] better and it is harder for us to find them - now they leave a beheaded body in one site and the head is buried five kilometres [three miles] away.\"It is hard to imagine how violence in El Salvador could go any further - and that is why many fear that the arrival of foreign organised criminal groups would be a nightmare come true.\\n', 'The blast in a town in Puebla state was apparently caused by thieves attempting to steal fuel from the pipeline.Oil gushed through the streets and caught fire, destroying homes and cars and forcing hundreds of people to flee.Mexican President Felipe Calderon has visited the scene and promised to launch an investigation.Puebla State Secretary Valentin Meneses said the explosion injured 52 people as well as destroying 32 houses and damaging scores more in San Martin Texmelucan - a small community about 80km (50 miles) east of Mexico City.He said that according to early indications, a criminal gang had punctured the pipeline.\"They lost control because of the high pressure with which the fuel exits the pipeline.

            "['His career high came in the 1970s and included the anthemic Baker Street and Stuck in the Middle with You, recorded with his band Stealers Wheel.Rafferty had battled a drink problem and spent time in hospital in Bournemouth with liver failure.He was born in Paisley and began his musical career as a busker on the London Underground.Rafferty died peacefully at his home in Dorset, with his daughter Martha at his bedside.It is understood his funeral will be held in Paisley later this month.Rafferty had recorded and toured with Billy Connolly as part of the Humblebums, before forming Stealers Wheel with his friend Joe Egan in 1972.Stuck in the Middle with You was a hit in the early 70s and also appeared on the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino\\'s debut film Reservoir Dogs in 1992.Baker Street charted in the UK and US in 1978 after Rafferty began his solo career and still achieves airplay on radio stations around the world.Musican Raphael Ravenscroft, who played the song\\'s famous saxophone melody, described Rafferty as \"a fantastic writer\" who \"wrote some of my favourite songs of all time.\"In a statement, Billy Connolly called Rafferty \"a hugely talented songwriter and singer who will be greatly missed\".He added, \"I was privileged to have spent my formative years working with Gerry and there remained a strong bond of friendship between us that lasted until his untimely death.\"Gerry had extraordinary gifts and his premature passing deprives the world of a true genius.\"Music journalist and BBC Radio 2 presenter Paul Gambaccini said it was a cruel irony that Baker Street, about Rafferty\\'s unhappiness with being a star, brought him more of the fame he hated.Gambaccini said: \"He just wasn\\'t of the constitution to deal with the music business, or to respect it.\"And thus he found fame and artistic success incompatible, and he became a wanderer, a lonely man, allegedly a drinker. And now we have this unhappy end.\"Musician and BBC 6 Music presenter Tom Robinson said Rafferty would be greatly missed.\"I\\'m deeply saddened to hear that Gerry has lost the battle with his failing health,\" he said.\"His early work with Stealers Wheel was an inspiration to a whole generation of songwriters in the 70s, including me.\"Many of us had hoped his recent album Life Goes On in 2009 would lead to a full-time return to writing and performing for a lyrical and highly gifted artist.\"BBC News website readers from around the world have sent in their tributes:Don\\'t Speak of My Heart was my favourite. His voice was like velvet.  Calmed me down just listening to him. I cannot believe he has gone. Susan Miller, Kilmaurs, Ayrshire, ScotlandHave followed his releases from Stealers Wheel to present. He wrote beautiful songs and he and Joe Egan, who sadly didn\\'t get the same recognition, have left me some great musical memories. George Morris, Donaghadee, County Down, Northern IrelandAs a muso myself, I loved the arrangement of the haunting Baker Street and often performed Stuck In The Middle With You with a band I was a part of in the 80s and 90s in England. Both songs are played frequently on New Zealand radio stations. Gerry will be sorely missed. Tony Last, Hastings, New ZealandMy first LP was Can I Have my Money Back, which I still have. My favourite song is The Ark from City to City with Jerry Donahue on guitar. He wrote about life itself, things one can relate to. He brought musical quality into life at times when there was not much around. Keith Dhan-Weller, Nuertingen, GermanyBaker Street is probably my favourite song. I\\'m a songwriter and I teach creative writing. Baker Street is about Gerry\\'s own experience with the music industry but he wrote the lyric in the third person. This makes the story more interesting and sad. The song works on so many different levels. Musically and lyrically. Richard Abbott, Limavady, Northern IrelandI was a young radio producer with BBC Scotland in the late 1960s when a couple of lads came in to Queen Margaret Drive to take part in some programmes. They were the Humblebums, and they made brilliant music. Rehearsals attracted all sorts of excuses from staff to absent themselves from their desks to go and listen in the studio cubicle. Little did we know... Alan Muirhead, Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria, EnglandMy eldest daughter was in school with his daughter Martha when Gerry lived in Kilmacolm. My husband and I were great fans of his music and songs and are sorry to hear of his death. Rita Walker, Greenock, ScotlandGerry Rafferty had depths beyond his two best-selling singles. A talented and open-minded musician who supported other talents - he will be missed. Alastair, Northampton, England\\n', 'Lithuania violated an article on free elections in the European Convention on Human Rights, the ruling said.Mr Paksas was impeached and removed from office as president after the Baltic state\\'s constitutional court found that he had abused his position.He is now a Euro MP in Strasbourg.The judgement by the Strasbourg court on Thursday is binding, meaning that Lithuania, an EU member state, will have to act on it to prevent any similar violation in future.But the judges did not award Mr Paksas compensation, saying their ruling was in itself \"sufficient just satisfaction\".Lithuania was found to have violated Article Three of Protocol One (Right to free elections) in the European Convention on Human Rights.In 2004 Mr Paksas became the first European head of state in modern times to be impeached and removed from office.The former Soviet republic\\'s constitutional court found that he had illegally arranged Lithuanian citizenship for a Russian-born businessman, Yuri Borisov.But Mr Paksas, an aerobatic pilot in Soviet times, was cleared of the charge of having leaked state secrets to Russia.After the constitutional court had backed Mr Paksas\\'s disqualification, the Lithuanian parliament adopted a new electoral rule barring anyone from becoming an MP if they had previously been dismissed in impeachment proceedings.Mr Paksas complained that the rule had been passed deliberately to bar him from office. He also said the constitutional court had lacked impartiality and had exceeded its powers.The Strasbourg judges accepted that a breach of the constitution was \"a particularly serious matter\", but they argued that Mr Paksas\\'s permanent and irreversible disqualification from running for election was disproportionate.In 2009 Mr Paksas was elected to the European Parliament. He sits with the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group, which seeks to defend national sovereignty and prevent the further concentration of power in Brussels.\\n', 'The Procession to Calvary, completed in 1602, will remain on show at Nostell Priory in West Yorkshire.The painting had been put up for sale for £2.7m. A campaign by The Art Fund and National Trust raised £1.7m.The National Heritage Memorial Fund, which aims to save key historic items, has now stepped in with the final £1m.The painting depicts Christ carrying the cross on his way to crucifixion and has hung at Nostell Priory, a stately home near Wakefield, for 200 years.The priory is the family home of Lord St Oswald, who put it up for sale to pay for the restoration of the estate.He had said he would put it up for auction if the target was not reached by Christmas.Members of the public donated £680,000 to the campaign, with almost £510,000 coming from trusts and foundations, while The Art Fund gave a further £500,000.Art Fund director Dr Stephen Deuchar said: \"Considering the economic climate, this has been a hugely challenging campaign and we are enormously grateful to all our members and supporters who have given so generously.\"Working with the National Trust has been a very fruitful experience, pooling our resources to pull out all the stops and save this remarkable painting for Nostell Priory and its visitors.\"Dame Jenny Abramsky, chair of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, said:  \"The overwhelming public support to help secure this stunning painting has been an inspiration.\"Individual giving combined with ongoing support from government funds such as the National Heritage Memorial Fund will play an increasingly important role in securing our most precious heritage.\"The fund\\'s money comes from the Treasury and is intended to be the last resort for saving items of importance to the UK\\'s national heritage.It has received £10m a year since 2007, but its grant will be halved from this year as a result of government cuts.\\n', 'Demonstrators marched outside the Iranian embassy accusing Tehran of interfering in Afghanistan\\'s affairs.Soaring fuel prices have angered many Afghans at a time of high demand during winter.Afghan officials say 2,500 fuel tankers are stranded at the border. Iran denies blocking fuel exports to Afghanistan.It is thought the Iranian government fears the fuel could be used by foreign forces, but Afghan officials say these concerns are unfounded.Earlier this week Iran\\'s ambassador in Kabul, Fadahoseyn Malaki, dismissed reports that Iran had barred fuel exports to Afghanistan.\"We give fuel to the Afghan nation,\" he told a news conference, although he added his government still had concerns which \"should be addressed\".Friday\\'s demonstration was led by Afghan MP Najib Kabuli, who has organised similar protests against Iran in the past.\\n', 'The name is expressed with affection by some, with hostility by others, but it calls up history for everyone.The story of his life is very much the story of our times: revolutionary movements, the Cold War, East v West, North v South, communism v capitalism - except that most of the world has passed him by.Fidel Castro has remained the same, a symbol of revolution, a communist who has survived the fall of communism.Before surgery took him out of public view in July 2006, he inspired his followers with slogans and five-hour speeches.Fidel\\'s views continued to be made public though in the form of editorials and occasional TV appearances.Fidel maintained his rule with an iron grip, sending opponents to prison for years.Throughout his leadership, he railed against the US, its economic and trade embargo and against the evils of free marketsFidel has been praised for standing up for the oppressed of Latin America, for opposing the Yankee imperialist, for making Cuba into a more equal society than many, for developing Cuba\\'s health service and sending doctors abroad to help others.And it wasn\\'t only doctors he sent abroad. He despatched troops to Angola and Ethiopia in support of fellow revolutionaries. His hand was seen in many a revolutionary movement in his own continent.But he has also been condemned for intolerance, for keeping his people poor and for refusing to see the benefits of economic liberalisation that even the communists of China have embraced.Fidel Castro stopped his people from leaving the island, leading them to risk their lives in rickety boats to try to get out.At one stage in the early years of the Reagan administration he was accused of trying to take over Central America for the Soviet Union by revolution.Washington at that time saw a path that led from the guerrillas of El Salvador through Nicaragua to Cuba and right up to the door of the Kremlin.Cuban assistance to the small and then revolutionary island of Grenada in the Caribbean prompted a full-scale US invasion.Throughout his rule, President Castro remained in almost permanent confrontation with the United States - and it with him.The American embargo on Cuba has been used by both sides - as a policy by the US to isolate Cuba and as an excuse by Fidel Castro for the island\\'s poverty.US President Barack Obama and Castro\\'s successor as president, younger brother Raul, announced a thawing in relations in 2015 but the embargo remains in place.When Mr Obama visited earlier this year - the first by a US leader in more than half a century - Castro remained defiant, saying Cuba did not need any gifts from the \"empire\" in a damning letter.He cut a giant figure on the world stage during the 47 years he controlled Cuba - at one point bringing the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war.It was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 that propelled him into worldwide prominence.Before that he had been just a glamorous revolutionary leader. He had overthrown the dictator Batista in a classic guerrilla war and had fought off an American-led invasion by Cuban exiles on the Bay of Pigs in 1961.But when Nikita Khrushchev decided, with Fidel Castro\\'s agreement, to station nuclear missiles in Cuba itself, the island leader turned from being a thorn in the side of the Americans into being a mortal threat.It was only the skilled diplomacy of Jack Kennedy (and of Khrushchev in the end) that saved the day, and Fidel\\'s own island from destruction.The then-US defence Secretary Robert McNamara met President Castro in 1992. He said the Cuban leader told him there were 162 nuclear missiles in Cuba at the time of the crisis.He asked Castro if he had recommended they be used. The answer was:\"Yes, I did.\"\"And what would have happened to Cuba?\" Mr McNamara asked him.\"It would have been destroyed.\"Fidel Castro was not part of the diplomacy that ended the missile crisis.But he came out of the crisis remarkably strengthened. Kennedy promised that the US would not invade Cuba, a promise that has held.The CIA made efforts to get rid of him with bizarre plots involving the Mafia and poison. They came to nothing. President Castro\\'s people took immense precautions to protect him from potential harm from food and drink, as diplomats who invite him to their receptions in Havana found out.He survived harm from his enemies.And whatever happens to Cuba after him, the name of Fidel will survive in history.\\n', 'The attack, which killed 270 people in the plane and on the ground, remains the deadliest terrorist incident ever to have taken place on British soil.He always denied he had been responsible, but a series of appeals was halted when he was diagnosed with cancer and, controversially, released from prison in Scotland on compassionate grounds.Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi was born in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, on 1 April 1952.He studied in the US and also visited Britain \"four or five times\" during the 1970s when he is said to have spent nine months studying in Cardiff.He described himself as the former director of Libya\\'s Centre for Strategic Studies, a role which - the FBI claimed - gave him cover to act as an intelligence officer for the Libyan Intelligence Services (JSO).Suggestions that he was related to the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, were never substantiated - but Megrahi had close connections to the Libyan government.He was a cousin of Said Rashid, a fellow senior JSO member and influential member of the government, who played a key role in Libya\\'s anti-US policies during the 1980s.It was his role as chief of security for Libyan Arab Airlines (LAA) which, prosecutors later argued, allowed him to carry out the bombing.LAA had an office in Malta, where Libyans were able to move freely. From there, Megrahi was able to use as many as four false passports to travel to Zurich, where the timing device for the bomb was made.Pan Am flight 103 left London\\'s Heathrow Airport at 1825 GMT on 21 Dec 1988, bound for New York with 243 passengers and 16 crew members on board.At just after 1900 an explosion in the plane\\'s forward cargo hold tore the side out of the Boeing 747 which quickly broke up and fell onto the small town of Lockerbie in the Dumfries & Galloway region of Scotland.As well as the 259 people on board the plane, 11 residents of Lockerbie died on the ground as a result of a giant fireball caused when a wing holding thousands of gallons of fuel exploded on impact.It was scraps of clothes wrapped around the bomb which detonated aboard the airliner that led investigators to a shop in Malta and, eventually, to Megrahi.In November 1991 Megrahi, and a fellow Libyan, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, were indicted by the Scottish Lord Advocate and the US Attorney General for the bombing of Flight 103.Libya refused to extradite the two men and Megrahi spent eight years living under armed guard - relying on a small LAA pension and work as a teacher - before he and his co-defendant were handed over for trial.Eventually, after protracted negotiations with Libya, it was agreed the trial would be held under Scots law but in a neutral country.The two men were handed over in 1999 and the trial finally began in May 2000 at Camp Zeist, a former US Air Force base in the Netherlands.In television interviews shown to the court, Megrahi appeared gentle. He told reporters: \"I\\'m a quiet man. I never had any problem with anybody,\" and said he felt sorry for the people of Lockerbie.After nine months, three Scottish judges found him guilty and a subsequent appeal was rejected. He was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 27 years. Fhimah was acquitted of all charges.Megrahi served the first part of his sentence in Glasgow\\'s Barlinnie prison, segregated in a high-security area dubbed \"Gaddafi\\'s Cafe\", where there was said to be a sitting room and kitchen where halal food was specially prepared.The former South African president Nelson Mandela, who had helped broker the deal which allowed the trial to take place, visited him there and called for him to be moved to a Muslim country to avoid harassment from other prisoners.However, in 2005, he was transferred to nearby HMP Greenock, where there were no special provisions and he mixed with other \"lifers\".Megrahi was given a fresh chance to clear his name when the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) referred his case back to appeal judges for a second time.In October 2008 It was announced that Megrahi was suffering from prostate cancer and his lawyers urged the court to speed up the appeal process.The hearing, which began in April  2009, had the backing of ex-Labour MP Tam Dalyell and Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the bombing.However, in Aug 2009, Megrahi abruptly withdrew his appeal and on 20 August the Scottish Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill, granted his release on compassionate grounds and he was flown back to Libya.The decision caused a storm of protest from politicians in both the UK and the United States, not least because of what was termed his \"hero\\'s welcome\" when he arrived home in Tripoli.The UK justice secretary, Jack Straw, was forced to publicly deny allegations that the British government had sanctioned Megrahi\\'s release in the interests of improving trade relations with Libya.Megrahi always maintained that he was innocent, a view that was shared by some commentators and relatives of the victims.In a statement released by his lawyers, Megrahi said: \"Many people, including the relatives of those who died in, and over, Lockerbie, are, I know, upset that my appeal has come to an end; that nothing more can be done about the circumstances surrounding the Lockerbie bombing. I share their frustration. I had most to gain and nothing to lose about the whole truth coming out - until my diagnosis of cancer.\"Considerable doubt has been raised over the safety of Megrahi\\'s conviction, and a number of conspiracy theories have circulated over the years as to who was responsible for the outrage.The withdrawal of his second appeal, and his subsequent death, has, according to some observers, made it less likely that the truth about the bombing of Pan Am 103 will ever be known.\\n', 'At least 44 more have been injured in the crush, which was reportedly triggered by a road accident.The pilgrims were returning from the Hindu shrine of Sabarimala, which is in a remote, mountainous, densely-forested area.Kerala Governor R S Gavai has said he is \"deeply shocked and saddened\".\"We have recovered 102 bodies. The rescue work is almost over,\" local police official Sanjay Kumar told the Associated Press news agency.The stampede happened at Pulmedu, near the town of Vandiperiyar in Idukki district, Indian media reported.Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims had gathered at the hill shrine on Friday, the last day of an annual festival.The festival runs for two months and attracts millions of visitors every year.Reports differed as to exactly how the deadly crush was triggered.The Indian PTI news agency said a jeep carrying pilgrims had driven into a crowd returning from the shrine, starting a panic.However, the Times of India reported that the incident happened when the jeep broke down and overturned as pilgrims tried to move it.It crushed a number of people and caused others to stumble, which then triggered the stampede, the report said.Correspondents say deadly stampedes are not unusual at Indian temples, where huge crowds gather in small areas with few safety measures or crowd controls.A similar tragedy happened at Sabaramila in 1999, when more than 50 people died in a stampede after a landslide on a crowded hillside.\\n', 'Tanzanian Ahmed Ghailani, 36, was found guilty in November of conspiracy to damage or destroy US property with explosives but was cleared of murder.After Ghailani\\'s acquittal on that and other charges, Congress barred US President Barack Obama from moving Guantanamo prisoners to the US.The charges related to the 1998 bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.In New York on Tuesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected Ghailani\\'s request for leniency, saying any mistreatment he claimed he had suffered at the hands of his captors \"pales in comparison to the suffering and the horror he and his confederates caused\".\"This crime was so horrible,\" he said. \"It was a cold-blooded killing and maiming of innocent people on an enormous scale.\"US Attorney General Eric Holder said the life sentence demonstrated the ability of the US justice system to hold terrorists accountable for their actions.\"We hope this life sentence brings some measure of justice to the victims of these attacks and their families and friends who have waited so long for this day,\" he said in a statement.By Laura TrevelyanBBC News, New YorkWhile the conviction was not the resounding one the justice department would have liked, Ghailani\\'s life imprisonment has been seized upon by the US Attorney General Eric Holder as showing the strength of the country\\'s courts.But it\\'s hard to see when the next civilian trial of a Guantanamo detainee will be, or indeed when President Barack Obama can close the Guantanamo Bay military prison.In the weeks following the Ghailani verdict late last year, Congress passed a law which prevented military funds from being used to transfer Guantanamo inmates to the US.This makes it practically very difficult for the Obama administration to empty the detention centre, and to move detainees and try them in civilian courts.\"As this case demonstrates, we will not rest in bringing to justice terrorists who seek to harm the American people, and we will use every tool available to the government to do so.\"Ahead of the sentencing, Ghailani had asked for leniency, saying he had never intended to kill anyone and that he had been tortured.In 2001 four co-conspirators were sentenced to life in prison over the August 1998 bombings, in which 224 people were killed.Prosecutors said Ghailani had conspired with al-Qaeda operatives to bomb the embassies, and helped buy the explosives that destroyed the US embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.US investigators said Ghailani had flown to Pakistan the night before the simultaneous bombings.He was indicted in the US in December 1998 but remained at large in Afghanistan and the Waziristan area of Pakistan, the US says. He was captured in July 2004 and transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006.Last year, the US stayed proceedings in a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay and transferred him to New York for the civilian trial.\\n', 'Set two years later on from This is England \\'86, the two-hour drama will deal with the aftermath of the events in that four-part series.\"Just when I think my love affair with This is England is over, it pulls me back in,\" Meadows said.Channel 4 has also confirmed that This is England \\'90, set in the rave era, is currently in development.Picking up the action at Christmas 1988, the story will focus on the relationship between the Lol and Woody characters.Meadows told the Stage newspaper that while Channel 4 \"would have happily had me go straight to 1990, I felt I needed something in-between.\"Channel 4\\'s head of drama Camilla Campbell said: \"We\\'re beyond excited that Shane, Warp Films and the cast have agreed to return with this feature length drama.\"It is set to pull together a lot of story threads from \\'86, leaving the way clear for a new series of This is England \\'90.\"This is England \\'86, which screened on Channel 4 last September, was named best TV drama at the South Bank Awards on Tuesday.The original film, written and directed by Meadows in 2006, told of an impressionable young boy who becomes involved with a gang of skinheads.\\n', 'Within minutes, water cannon showered the demonstrators and there were loud thuds as tear gas canisters were fired.People ran into the side streets of this poor neighbourhood, on the edge of the capital, with their eyes streaming.\"Let the world see what is happening in this country,\" yelled one elderly man. \"We will never stop until this... government goes.\"Ordinary Egyptians appear to be losing their fear of direct confrontation with the security forces. There have been bloody and drawn out clashes all over Cairo and in some of Egypt\\'s main cities.They have a long list of grievances and the demands are an explicit challenge to their rulers.\"We want a real democratic system. This regime of Hosni Mubarak has been in power for 30 years,\" declared Ahmed, a man in his 20s.\"I was unemployed for five years. I had to move to the United Arab Emirates. This is what I was dragged into. My son will not suffer what I have suffered. This ends here.\"When you talk to people, they tell you economic reforms have not eased the poverty of Egypt\\'s masses, education and social services are inadequate, and they complain of high levels of corruption and  political stagnation.\"We are so furious. We must have change, better chances to work, to buy a flat and have just the life\\'s basics,\" said a bank clerk clutching an Egyptian flag.\"What happened in Tunisia has changed things a bit. It knocked some sense into people.\"Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei - who joined worshippers in Giza - was swiftly moved inside the gates of the mosque as clashes began.\"One, two, ElBaradei where are you?\" was the cry that then went up outside.Some expressed disappointment that the Nobel Laureate - who set up the National Association for Change opposition coalition when he returned home to Egypt a year ago - had not taken a more prominent role in protests.He has put up supportive messages on his Twitter account but was absent, in Vienna, for the first \"Day of Rage\" on Tuesday. He returned to Cairo on Thursday night.\"I support ElBaradei, my father wants (Arab League Secretary General) Amr Musa,\" one man said.\"We could have ElBaradei or anyone else,\" added Amgad, who had brought his young children along to witness the protest. \"We need change, not any specific person.\"The main opposition movement, the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, subtly changed its message ahead of the latest protests.Despite the reported arrest of some senior figures, deputy leader Mahmoud Izzat spoke encouragingly of the protests.\"People are demanding freedom, the dissolution of this invalid parliament. From the beginning this is what the young people have been shouting and we are with them,\" Mr Izzat told the al-Jazeera news channel.And he went on to criticise \"the excessive force\" of the security services.With multiple flashpoints across Egypt, many thousands of uniformed police, plain-clothed officers and paid thugs have been deployed.They line the bridges and main routes into central Cairo. While they remain strong and well-resourced, there have been unprecedented sights.In one case, a group of protesters tried to push an armoured vehicle into the River Nile.Attempts to close down mobile phone communications and access to Facebook, Twitter and Blackberrry messenger appear to have been ineffective in preventing the co-ordination of opposition activities.Demonstrators in the capital have simply regrouped in traditional gathering places downtown - such as Ramses Square and Tahrir Square.With Egyptians tuned into Arab satellite stations to watch dramatic scenes unfold, a curfew in Egypt\\'s main cities was announced.However, as sirens blared on the darkening streets it was unclear how effective this will be.\\n', 'Moderate exercise increased the size of the hippocampus, an area of the brain that makes memories, in 120 volunteers.The year-long trial, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed performance on memory tests also improved.Exercise may buffer against dementia as well as age-related memory loss.The latest work looked at healthy people in their 60s rather than people with Alzheimer\\'s or other forms of dementia.But the findings have important implications for ageing societies faced with a dementia time bomb.In the UK, 820,000 people have dementia, and this figure is set to double by 2030.Until a cure is discovered, finding cheap and simple ways to reverse this trend is imperative, say experts.Professor Kirk Erickson and colleagues from the University of Pittsburgh in the US set out to investigate the impact that even moderate exercise might have on preserving memory.They split their 120 volunteers into two groups. One group was asked to begin an exercise regimen of walking around a track for 40 minutes a day, three days a week, while the others were limited to doing simple stretching and toning exercises.Brain scans and memory tests were performed at the start of the study, halfway through the study and again at the end.Scans revealed hippocampus volume increased by around 2% in people who did regular aerobic exercise. The same region of the brain decreased in volume by 1.4% in those who did stretching exercises, consistent with the decrease seen in normal ageing.Both groups showed some improvement over time on memory tests. In the walking group, the improvement appeared to be linked with increased size of the hippocampus.Professor Erickson said: \"We think of the atrophy of the hippocampus in later life as almost inevitable. But we\\'ve shown that even moderate exercise for one year can increase the size of that structure.\"The brain at that stage remains modifiable.\"Dr Simon Ridley of the Alzheimer\\'s Research Trust said that although the study does not look at memory loss in Alzheimer\\'s or dementia, it suggests \"it\\'s never too late to start exercising to help keep our brains healthy\".\"Even modest exercise may improve memory and help protect the brain from normal decline caused by ageing.\"Increasing evidence suggests regular exercise and a healthy diet may help reduce our risk of developing dementia as well as reaping numerous other benefits from living a healthy lifestyle.\"\\n', 'Elin Jones is expected to lay out plans where some areas of Welsh forest could be transferred to the private sector or to not for profit organisations.But she has already ruled out the widespread sale of Welsh woodlands.Forestry Commission Wales said it would explore the feasibility of transfer to the private sector case by case.The minister told BBC Radio Wales she plans to \"compensate\" the public by buying new land for new planting or management if any forest was sold off on a case-by-case basis.\"I don\\'t want any stagnancy in the forest estate. I want it to work for public benefit whether that\\'s economic or environmental or access benefit,\" she said.\"It\\'s my view there should be no reduction in the publicly owned estate and I have asked the Forestry Commission to look at how it can make that estate work harder, provide a better return for the public.\"Whether that\\'s in terms of public access, in terms of environmental benefit in the production of renewable energy or biomass potential or also in terms of the economic return from that forestry estate.\"The minister is due to outline her plans to AMs during Tuesday\\'s plenary session in the Senedd.Further commercialisation being planned would include partnerships with the private sector for more forest holidays, wind farms and limited extraction of coalfield methane.Around 37% of Welsh woodland comes under the Assembly Government Woodland Estate (AGWE).A report commissioned by the assembly examined a number of options, including a complete sell-off of the land to the private sector or a not-for-profit trust.It warned there were potential difficulties with both of these, instead recommending that a case-by-case approach should be taken to the future of Wales\\' forests.Jerry Langford, the Woodland Trust\\'s director in Wales gave a guarded welcome and said the plans were \"considered and enlightened\".\"If these changes do lead to more native woodland creation and a new urgency for the restoration of ancient woodlands planted with conifers, this could be the start of a new \\'age of the tree\\' in Wales,\" he said.Any sell-off in Wales would release resources to the FC to purchase other areas of land not currently under its management to increase their public benefit.Overall, there would be no reduction in the size of the Welsh forests in public ownership.The report states: \"The minister agreed that FC Wales should adopt whenever possible a more commercial approach to its management of the estate and in particular to be pro-active and imaginative in exploring opportunities for deeper commercialisation when dealing with the private sector.\"Forestry Commission Wales said it would \"explore the feasibility of small-scale transfer to the third sector on a case by case basis\".A spokesman said: \"This would be subject to proper safeguards being in place to ensure that the woodland continues to be sustainably managed and that it can continue to deliver key benefits such as access for the public.\"\\n', 'The UK must go further to ensure those settling learn English \"so they can be more integrated into our country\".Asked about the issue at Prime Minister\\'s Questions, Mr Cameron said the last government had made progress on the issue, but more had to be done.He agreed parents should be responsible for making sure children speak English.Conservative MP for Keighley Kris Hopkins asked if the PM agreed that there was \"a responsibility and an obligation\" on parents to make sure their children can speak English when they start school.Mr Cameron replied: \"I completely agree... in too many cases this isn\\'t happening.\"Since last autumn, people from outside the EU applying for a visa to join their spouse or partner now have to prove they have a basic command of English before their application is approved.Previously, visa applicants had to show only that their marriage or partnership was genuine and that they could financially support themselves.The prime minister told the Commons: \"The last government did make some progress on making sure people learnt English when they came to our country, I think we need to go further.\"If you look at the figures for the number of people who are brought over as husbands and wives, particularly from the Indian sub-continent, we should be putting in place - and we will be putting in place -  tougher rules to make sure they do learn English and so when they come, if they come, they can be more integrated into our country.\"The weekly session of Prime Minister\\'s Questions was dominated by foreign affairs with Labour leader Ed Miliband focusing all his six questions on events in Egypt and the UK\\'s mission in Afghanistan.Mr Miliband, who visited Afghanistan for the first time as Labour leader last week, paid an extended tribute to soldiers\\' work there, acknowledged the difference in the Commons session from the normal political point scoring.Mr Cameron welcomed the opportunity to have a \"serious conversation\" about the work of British soldiers in Afghanistan, saying they wanted politicians to discuss their efforts, although he also noted  many MPs often \"preferred a bunfight\" about domestic issues.\\n', 'He made the pledge to the UN General Assembly in New York in 2012, saying Myanmar (also known as Burma)  was on a path from which it would not backtrack. His visit to the United States was the first by a Burmese leader in 46 years.Thein Sein, 67, took office in March 2011, after the country\\'s first election in 20 years in November 2010. Since then, he has led a process of reform in Myanmar, ruled for decades by a military junta of which he was a key member.Under his administration the government has freed hundreds of prisoners, including political detainees, embarked on peace deals with ethnic minority groups and relaxed media censorship.He has been welcomed cautiously onto the world stage, despite warnings from critics that many key tests remain for Myanmar\\'s reform process.This warning was echoed in November 2014 by opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who said that the pace of reform had stalled.Born in a small village in the delta of the Irrawaddy river, in an area now known as Ngapudaw township, Thein Sein was from a humble background.  His parents were farmers, he said.He graduated with an arts degree from Burma\\'s military academy in 1968 and rose steadily through the ranks in his 40-year career.He reached the leadership circle in the 1990s when he became a member of the State Peace and Development Council, as the junta called itself at the time.He was made first secretary of the council after the downfall of former intelligence chief General Khin Nyunt in 2004. Thein Sein also chaired the National Convention, which drafted the country\\'s new constitution.When the previous prime minister, Soe Win, fell ill, Thein Sein was made acting prime minister in May 2007.Confirmed in the post in October that year, he became the public face of the regime, representing it at Asean and UN meetings. He served as prime minister for four years.In April 2010, like many other top junta officials, he swapped military uniform for civilian garb to form a political party.It was Thein Sein who applied to register the United Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which dominated the elections in November 2010 and has sweeping control of the parliament.Analysts said at the time that his appointment was orchestrated by junta leader Than Shwe, who needed an acceptable face to front the country\\'s transition.\"He won\\'t rock the boat,\" said Aung Zaw, editor of the Thailand-based Irrawaddy magazine, speaking when he took office.\"He is not a fire-breathing dragon, so he doesn\\'t pose any threat to Than Shwe, who will continue to exercise absolute power.\"But once he took office, Thein Sein\\'s government began a process of change that surprised his critics.He met freed pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who subsequently chose to bring her NLD party back into the political process, having boycotted the November polls.The NLD contested by-elections which were deemed by observers to be largely free and fair.Over the years since her release Thein Sein appears to have developed a good working relationship with Ms Suu Kyi.   Media reports made much of the fact that he met her, congratulated her on receiving the US Congressional Medal of Honor and referred to her as a Nobel laureate publicly.Known to be quiet by nature, Thein Sein has engaged more with international media.  He began a steady push for the West to lift sanctions, something he said was a necessity for democracy to thrive and the lives of Myanmar\\'s people to improve.\"There is a quiet determination to him, he is quiet and soft-spoken but will not flinch from a question posed to him,\" Vijay Nambiar, the UN\\'s top adviser on Myanmar, told Bloomberg.Asked in a BBC interview whether he was afraid he would be swept away by the winds of change like Mikhail Gorbachev after the fall of the Soviet Union, Thein Sein answered: \"I would like to say that Gorbachev and I are not alike, I tell you that.\\'\\'We are not making reforms because I want to. We are merely responding to the people\\'s desire for reform. Therefore my future depends on the people and their wishes.\"But he was clear that the military would always have a key role in politics. He also made no apology for its past actions, such as imprisoning dissidents and activists.\"They were acting on their beliefs and we were acting on our beliefs,\" he said. \"Everyone was working for the country in their own way.\"\\n', 'This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people.  I got it like other people on our network.  The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos.  I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence.  I\\'ve been sleeping here most of the time since.Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change.  It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks.I like to think the social network is the people itself.  Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools.  When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it\\'s about people.  Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline.This is something that people dreamt of but didn\\'t anticipate happening in reality.  If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted.  It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square.At the moment I\\'m not getting a lot of internet connection.  I\\'m trying not to drain my phone battery. We\\'re still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we\\'ve sorted through.I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.  At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet.Twitter: Amr GharbeiaI was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I\\'ve now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I\\'d never been part of a demonstration on the ground.At first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a \"Facebook revolution\". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn\\'t believe how it turned into something so different from what we\\'ve seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping.Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what\\'s going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I\\'m well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom.Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it\\'s about time that we start to live like real people.Twitter: Nawara NegmI\\'m not writing my blog right now.  We\\'re just using Twitter as it\\'s easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square.The internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people\\'s anger.In the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we\\'re trying to set an example of how we can all live together.  It\\'s like a city inside the city here.  We are the kernel of the revolution.Blog: MaLek X (in Arabic)The revolution was publicised on the internet.  The spark was Facebook.  People were really sceptical about it because they didn\\'t think you could have a revolution where you named the date, but now I look around me and I am really proud of the Egyptian people and the initiative.  I\\'m sure that those who named the date didn\\'t think things would go this far.To begin with on 25 January, we had mostly young people of all classes who somehow use the internet.  You have internet cafes even in the poorest areas of Egypt so even less well-educated people have access, especially to Facebook.  A lot was also achieved through word of mouth - people telling their friends and neighbours.  The independent media took a middle-ground to begin with as everyone was watching their backs but now they have got onboard.After our huge turnout on the first Tuesday, demonstrations continued for the next two days and we publicised further action for Friday on the internet.  That day they cut our communications and took our cameras so we had an information blackout and the violence was unbelievable. A lot of people died.Still the threshold of fear and pain had been broken and we have kept up momentum since. Now older people especially come up to us when we\\'re collecting trash or whatever in the square and they say: \"We\\'re really proud of you... You did what we didn\\'t manage to do for 60 years.\"People have called this the \"Facebook Revolution\" because it gave us a form of expression even when people were too scared to talk in big groups about political issues.  We had already set up Facebook pages for people who were tortured to death.  We found it was a way to talk without being tracked.In the square we have bridged a lot of gaps.  I\\'ve been living here since 29 January with tens of thousands of other people.  I put my head down to sleep and I don\\'t know the people sleeping around me. I have wonderful conversations with people from all over Egypt who normally I would never have talked to.We\\'re finally getting to know each other. It\\'s wonderful.\\n', 'The X-47B jet is being designed by weapons manufacturer Northrop Grumman for the US Navy.It was in the air for 29 minutes during its maiden flight and reached an altitude of 5,000 feet.Officials say it will help form part of a new generation of unmanned drones and works like a smaller version of the B-2 Stealth Bomber.As such it would be very different from the current fleet of remote controlled military planes like the Predator and Reaper.Instead the X-47B would be virtually invisible to radar and fly at much faster speeds than those older, propeller driven machines.In a statement Captain Jaime Engdahl, a programme manager for the warplane, said: \"Today we got a glimpse towards the future as the Navy\\'s first-ever tailless, jet-powered unmanned aircraft took to the skies.\"The flight was primarily designed to test the jet\\'s guidance and navigation systems and the aerodynamic control of the tailless design.It was controlled from the ground by a joint team of the company\\'s engineers and Navy specialists.Northrop is building the bomber as part of a Â£395 million contract signed in 2007.Janis Pamiljans is vice-president of Northrop Grumman\\'s Aerospace Systems sector.\"Designing a tailless, fighter-sized unmanned aircraft from a clean sheet is no small feat.\"Commitment, collaboration and uncompromising technical excellence among the Navy [and] Northrop Grumman made today\\'s flight a reality.\"We are indeed honoured to have given wings to the Navy\\'s vision for exploring unmanned carrier aviation.\"Although it will be several years before the X-47B is ready for operations officials say it should have its first test flight from an aircraft carrier in 2013.Follow Radio 1\\'s technology reporter Dan Whitworth on Twitter\\n']\n",

            "['When The Beatles first performed at the Cavern on 9 February, 1961, it was so low key it wasn\\'t even advertised.A year and a half, and 292 performances, later, the group was set for stardom and the Cavern would become one of the world\\'s most famous clubs.While both Lennon and McCartney had already played the club as The Quarrymen, the un-advertised lunchtime session was George Harrison\\'s first appearance at the Cavern.The club\\'s lunchtime sessions were popular with young city centre office workers and many would take sandwiches to eat while watching the groups.The current Cavern has organised a day of events to mark the anniversary and is inviting regulars from the early 1960s to attend. The day of live Beatles music starts with a lunchtime session at 1300 GMT.A 40-metre long light installation is being created across Mathew Street, called Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It will create a ceiling of light along the Cavern Quarter area.The original Cavern had started life as a jazz venue in 1957 but by 1961 it was moving towards rock and roll - driven more by plain economics than any change in musical taste.Promoter Sam Leach was instrumental in transforming the Cavern\\'s music policy away from the jazz favoured by owner Ray McFall.Mr Leach said: \"It was a good club and it was exciting.\"Ray McFall hated rock and roll. On March 11th 1961, I did the Iron Door (a rival Liverpool club)  - I did an all night session and it got 1,800 people, that night the Cavern had 50 people in, more musicians than fans.\"Ten days later...Ray gets the message and he turns over to rock and roll at night. Up until then The Beatles only played at lunchtime.\"The Beatles had played other Merseyside venues since returning from Hamburg in late 1960, but it was at the Cavern that they would cement their reputation as one of the city\\'s top rock and roll groups.Many who saw The Beatles at the club claim that was where they were at their best as a live outfit. Mr Leach\\'s first taste of The Beatles was at a venue in Huyton.He said: \"When I first saw them in Hamilton Hall as soon as they started playing, I was just gobsmacked.\"The sound didn\\'t just go over you it went through you.\"John Lennon started with Slow Down and Paul did Hippy Hippy Shake, Stuart did Wooden Heart, Pete Best did Matchbox. The sound was so powerful, it seemed to reverberate around the hall.\"We more or less took American rock and roll and sent it back at them improved. We gave them better sound, which was Merseybeat.\"Make no mistake the Cavern has become the most famous club in the world.\"It makes me smile when they say: \\'The Cavern where it all began\\' - they were the last ones in. But it was an exciting club.\"In November 1961, record store manager Brian Epstein saw The Beatles at the Cavern and soon after became their manager.A record deal with Parlophone would follow but not before the band\\'s sound and image had been subtlety changed.\"The Beatles were the best rock band on the planet\", Mr Leach remembers.\"Eppy [Brian Epstein] took them and he groomed them, and took all that rawness out of them, and fair enough it worked. But I know John didn\\'t like it because John was an out and out rock and roller.\"Paul was sensible he knew you had to sort of bend a little bit and become a bit more showbiz. So he went along with Epstein and really, Paul was right.\"Paul McCartney returned his roots at the Cavern in December 1999 to play a one-off concert, but it wasn\\'t on the same stage that he had played from almost 300 times in the early 1960s.The original Cavern club closed in 1973 and was demolished to make way for a ventilation shaft for Liverpool\\'s new underground railway loop line. The shaft was never built and the current Cavern club is recreated across three quarters of the original site, using many of the old club\\'s bricks.Exactly three year\\'s after their first Cavern appearance on 9 February, 1964, The Beatles performed on The Ed Sullivan Show playing to a record 73 million people across America.Beatlemania had arrived.\\n', 'So what is the levy? What\\'s really at stake? And why raise the rate now?What is the bank levy?It is an annual tax on the value of all of the debts of the UK banks (including money deposited with the banks), except that:Originally, the Treasury had planned to charge a lower rate of 0.05% during 2011, but in February it changed its mind, and switched to the standard rate of 0.075% from May.The standard rate was originally set at 0.075%, but it was raised slightly in March to 0.078%, and is now being raised again, to 0.088%, from January.What\\'s it for?The government thinks it will discourage banks from relying on risky forms of borrowing, which were blamed for making the 2008 crisis much more dangerous.The tax will also raise a lot of money for the government.So will this help deal with the budget deficit?The Treasury hopes the tax will bring in £2.6bn every year.That\\'s equivalent to 2.1% of the Office for Budget Responsibility\\'s forecast for the budget deficit this year.It\\'s no small amount for the banks either. It\\'s equivalent to about 19% of the reported profits before tax of the big five UK banks over the 12 months to September this year - although the tax burden will be borne by more than just these five.What\\'s risky about the type of borrowing that the government wants to discourage?Traditionally, most of the money that banks lend out comes from the deposits they receive from ordinary people and companies.But during the past decade, banks found new and more complex ways to borrow trillions of pounds from international markets.Unlike ordinary deposits, there is no natural limit on the availability of this money, as it can come from anywhere in the globe, and the same money can be recycled between the banks again and again.A lot of the debts created were very short-term - meaning the banks needed to go back to the markets to reborrow every few days.When the financial crisis hit, investors began to worry that banks might not be able to repay their debts.This caused a kind of bank run, with investors refusing to lend.Unable to refinance all of their short-term debts, even profitable banks were threatened with failure.Why are retail deposits exempt from the levy?Bank runs are popularly associated with long queues of ordinary depositors wanting to empty their bank accounts - just as happened to Northern Rock.But since the 1930s, governments have insured most of the money deposited by their citizens in order to discourage these depositor bank runs. Indeed, the government responded to the Northern Rock crisis by promising to guarantee all of its deposits.In the UK, the first £85,000 of an individual\\'s money is insured (it used to be £35,000 before the financial crisis).This means that most depositors do not need to worry about the safety of their money during a financial crisis, and the banks don\\'t need to worry about all those deposits being withdrawn.So why not just insure all the banks\\' borrowings?The bank levy was actually first proposed to all countries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a type of insurance scheme.The IMF said the money raised should be channelled into a special fund that could be used to pay for the cost of cleaning up future banking crises.However, the UK government took the view that these borrowings are inherently risky, and wanted to discourage them altogether by taxing them.If the debts were insured, lenders would see them as less risky, making them a cheaper and easier way for banks to borrow.The government\\'s fear is that the banks would then just continue taking on more and more debt, until they became impossibly large to rescue - as proved the case in the Republic of Ireland or Iceland.Indeed, the total debts of the UK\\'s banks had already reached a staggering 4.5 times the size of the entire UK economy before the crisis.Some might also point out another reason why the government chose not to go for an insurance scheme.By making it a tax instead, the revenue raised can be channelled straight to the Treasury, helping to pay for the government\\'s own spending.Why is the first £20bn of debts exempt from the tax?The government wants to encourage banks to shrink.The thinking is that the collapse of a big bank could threaten the stability of the entire financial system, whereas the failure of a small bank should not.The £20bn figure is about the size of the Coventry Building Society. So it means banks will only pay the tax to the extent they are bigger than that.Why is the tax rate lower on long-term debts?Longer-term debts are inherently less risky.Financial crises - at least the most intense part of them - tend to be over in a matter of a few weeks or months.If a bank does not have to repay its debts for more than a year, then it can probably ride out the crisis.Will the levy really discourage banks?The tax will increase the cost of \"risky\" short-term borrowing for banks by just under one-tenth of a percentage point.This may seem small, but it will eat into the banks\\' precious margins - the difference between the interest they pay on their deposits and what they earn on their lending - which is their main source of income.However, the banks may pass some of the tax cost on to their savers (via a lower deposit rate) or their borrowers (via a higher lending rate).But to get the 0.088% in context, the Bank of England slashed short-term borrowing costs by 5.2 percentage points in response to the financial crisis.Why did the government want to phase the levy in?The original plan was to charge 0.05% for 2011, before going up to the full 0.075% rate next year (increased to 0.078% in March).The government didn\\'t want to raise the banks\\' borrowing costs at a time when their financial stability was still in question.They also did not want to sap the banks\\' profits too quickly.The banks might need to use all the profits they could get to rebuild their capital - their buffer against future losses - in order to meet tough new international standards being set by the Basel committee of banking regulators.So why did the government change its mind?In February, the Treasury said it wanted to charge the full £2.6bn this year after all.It pointed to the Bank of England\\'s latest Financial Stability Report, which painted a much rosier picture of the UK\\'s banks.Moreover, the new Basel rules on bank capital won\\'t take full effect until 2019, giving banks a full eight years to meet the higher standards.It probably also helped that the banks have been reporting much better profits than many would have expected a year ago.And markets seemed less and less concerned about the risk of lending to banks - at least until the eurozone debt crisis flared up since the summer of 2011.Why is the government raising the rate again?The chancellor raised the rate to 0.088% in his Autumn Statement.According to the Treasury, the tax was not on course to raise the £2.6bn originally planned for this year.The Treasury said that it had simply overestimated how much borrowing is done by foreign banks in the UK - and is therefore subject to the tax.It could also be that banks have been reducing their borrowing. Foreign banks may be moving their borrowing offshore to avoid the tax.And all banks may be cutting back their borrowing and lending requirements in response to the recession, the eurozone financial crisis, and stricter regulatory requirements.Which banks will have to pay most?The Treasury does not say how much of its £2.6bn target it expects to be paid by each bank.British banks face a bigger burden than foreign banks that do business in the UK, because the British banks must pay the levy on all their borrowing worldwide, and not just on their borrowing in the UK.That has led to suggestions that some banks - perhaps Standard Chartered, HSBC and Barclays - may relocate their headquarters to another country in order to reduce their tax bill.Moreover, the probability is that the tax will hit Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group hardest.It may seem perverse to tax most heavily the two banks in which the government has the biggest stake.But one of the reasons the government ended up owning these banks is precisely because they (in the case of Lloyds, because of its merger with the Halifax) had become too dependent on riskier forms of financing, and had to be rescued during the crisis.\\n', 'Alex McKechnie, then 16, was in the crowd for that first show and went on to be a regular at the club:\"I saw The Beatles a few times in the north end of Liverpool and was working in Liverpool city centre as a messenger boy in a printing works when I heard that they were on at the Cavern in a lunchtime session.\"The Cavern was in the basement of a three or four storey warehouse. The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches.\"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That\\'s where the Beatles performed 292 times.\"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there.\"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn\\'t just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them.\"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them.\"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool.\"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff.\"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous.\"It wasn\\'t just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage.\"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn\\'t give a serious answer, and that\\'s how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that\\'s why I think they liked it in the Cavern.\"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren\\'t trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose.\"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them.\"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn\\'t really concentrate on doing any work.\"Just in a few weeks they\\'d gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you\\'d seen them, not many people didn\\'t go to see them again.\"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I\\'d dumped them.\"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal.\"I wasn\\'t the only one. I think the ones who thought that they\\'d discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me.\"Alex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs.The Cavern is celebrating the anniversary with a series of tribute events on Wednesday. A documentary about the first gig will be broadcast on ITV1 at 2240 GMT on Wednesday.\\n', 'During the first nine months of 1938, he oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK.He worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees.Yet, amazingly, his self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge.Nicholas George Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in the well-heeled Hampstead district of north London.His Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 1907 and changed the family name from Wertheim to Winton.They had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was baptised.In 1923, Winton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. Although he left without attaining any qualifications, he had become imbued with a love of mathematics.He continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany, where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin.In 1931, just two years before Hitler became German chancellor, he moved to work in Paris before returning to London.His mother\\'s family had remained in Germany and that, together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London, made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis.In December 1938, Winton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague, where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees.He visited camps for refugees from the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia, which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France.British activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees, but Winton\\'s great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home.He was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17, as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home.Winton set up an office in a hotel in Prague, where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia.On his return to London, he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport, just one of a number of  initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories.Winton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home. It was not always easy.\"The problem was getting the people who would accept the children, and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south [of England] was taking place anyway,\" he said.\"It\\'s marvellous that so many people did come forward. The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help.\"I tried America but they didn\\'t take any. It would have made a vast difference if they had.\"In the first eight months of 1939, eight trains left Prague taking 669 children to safety. A further 15 were flown out via Sweden.The ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two.\"Within hours of the announcement, the train disappeared,\" Winton later recalled. \"None of the 250 children on board was seen again.\"We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain. If the train had been a day earlier, it would have come through.\"Winton registered as a conscientious objector and served for a time as an ambulance driver, before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned.He told no-one about his pre-war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrapbook in the attic containing a mass of documents, including the names of the rescued children.In July of that year, Winton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That\\'s Life, and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend.Until they arrived in the studio, they had no idea that Winton was the man who had saved them.Winton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes and, in 2003, was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport.In 2007, he received the Czech Republic\\'s highest military decoration, the Cross of the 1st Class, and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize.A train dubbed \"The Winton Train\" left Prague station on 1 September 2009, exactly 70 years after the last Kindertransport had been due to depart from the Czech capital.In October 2014, at the age of 105, he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic\\'s highest honour, the Order of the White Lion.In his acceptance speech, he was typically modest: \"In a way, I shouldn\\'t have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exaggerate things the way they are doing today.\"It was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who summed up the vital role of those who, like Winton, tried to save Europe\\'s Jewish children from the Nazis:\"In those times there was darkness everywhere. In Heaven and on Earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed.\"The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference. Only a few had the courage to care.\"\\n', 'Colin Hughes was attacked in Old Swan in September 2010 as he went to investigate a noise at the door of his  home.Two men, aged 18 and 21, from Old Swan and Huyton, were arrested on suspicion of murder on Tuesday.Detectives have arrested six people as part of the inquiry, but no-one has been charged.Mr Hughes had been playing cards with his fiancee Paula Greenwood when they heard the glass in the back door smash at about 0045 BST on 21 September.Ms Greenwood went to call the police while Mr Hughes, a chef at a local pub, went to investigate.

Mr Besigye and his wife have one son.He was born in the western Rukungiri District, the second child in a family of six and the son of a policeman.Besigye\\'s dates with history:Both his parents died while he was at secondary school.In 1975, he headed to Kampala and to medical school at what was then the region\\'s most prestigious university, Makerere.Idi Amin was president of Uganda at the time and his army was causing misery in many areas of the country, including on the university campus.Mr Besigye did not escape that treatment. Aged 18, he was in a Kampala hotel about to have dinner. Walking to the toilets, he stopped to talk to a former classmate.A huge man lifted him up by the collar, slapped him hard across the face and sent him sprawling to the floor.He said he never made it to the toilets, and never ate his dinner. He picked himself up and ran for his life.Following Amin\\'s overthrow, the qualified doctor became a member of the Uganda People\\'s Movement of Yoweri Museveni.The movement had little success in the 1980 election which saw the return of Milton Obote to power, and which is widely considered to have been rigged.Mr Besigye told the East African newspaper that he did not immediately join Mr Museveni in the bush war.But he was imprisoned for two months in the Nile Hotel in 1981, accused of working with the rebels, and tortured.Mr Besigye fled to Nairobi and in 1982 joined Mr Museveni in the bush, where he became his personal doctor.Although rarely at the battle front, Mr Besigye was deployed in divisions which were sent into battle where he treated the casualties.Kizza Besigye on his 2001-2005 exile:\"I left in order to continue to be politically active rather than being behind bars or six feet under as had been threatened\"When Mr Museveni came to power, Mr Besigye, aged just 29, was appointed state minister of internal affairs and national political commissar.These appointments shocked some who had been in the bush with Mr Besigye, as he had not been heavily involved in the political side of the bush war.Some believe Mr Besigye\\'s rapid rise led to him being viewed as a potential threat to the president, and as a result he was given less demanding work during the 1990s.Mr Besigye rose to the rank of colonel in the army but did not retire from it until shortly before the 2001 elections - having written a document that accused the ruling National Resistance Movement of being undemocratic, dishonest and corrupt. It almost earned him a court martial.A few months before the election, he emerged as a presidential candidate.Having lost to Mr Museveni, he went to court and challenged the result on the grounds that the state had used force, intimidation and violence.He lost the case on a split decision and then fled the country.On his return in 2005 he said: \"I left in order to continue to be politically active rather than being behind bars or six feet under as had been threatened.\"More on Uganda\\'s election:After he returned to Uganda ahead of the 2006 elections, he was arrested and charged with both treason and rape.The charges were later dismissed, but not until long after the polls and they obviously distracted him from campaigning.The rape prosecution was dismissed as \"crude and amateurish\" but the treason charges hung over his head until 2010.His lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the 2006 results, alleging widespread fraud. Mr Besigye won 37%.The government says Mr Besigye has connections with a rebel group, and this accusation led to charges.He denied any rebel link, although he has said he would not rule out going to the bush to battle the government if the constitution was overthrown and needed to be reinstated.After he lost the last election in 2011, Mr Besigye said all the votes were flawed.Before the 2011 polls, Mr Besigye had called for popular uprisings in the event of fraud.And after gaining 26% to the president\\'s 68% in the vote, the leader of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) claimed it was rigged.After the election he continued to campaign against the result, along with the rising cost of living, by staging \"walk to work\" protests.He was arrested four times, accused of inciting violence and beaten by police during the protests before all charges were dropped.Human rights groups condemned the brutality of the police and military.His critics see him as a power-hungry attention seeker. But others praise him for standing up to authority.Mr Besigye himself says his mission is \"to work with millions of other Ugandans in bringing about a stable democratic and peaceful Uganda\".\\n', 'Almost completely cut off for centuries, it has tried to let in some aspects of the outside world while fiercely guarding its ancient traditions.The Bhutanese name for Bhutan, Druk Yul, means \"Land of the Thunder Dragon\" and it only began to open up to outsiders in the 1970s.The Wangchuck hereditary monarchy has wielded power since 1907.

Others managed to crawl out of the rubble.By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC NewsBy nature, earthquakes tend to cluster in space and time.And Tuesday\\'s tremor in Christchurch is almost certainly related to the much more energetic event that hit the region last September.The critical difference on this occasion is the ground broke almost directly under the country\\'s second city, and at shallow depth, 5km (3 miles) below the surface.Contrast this with September\\'s magnitude 7 quake: its epicentre occurred some 40km west of the city and at a depth of 10km, and it continued to rupture mainly away from the major built-up areas.New Zealand lies on the notorious Ring of Fire, the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.The country straddles the boundary between two tectonic plates: the Pacific and Indo-Australian plates.On South Island, the location of the latest quake, the plates rub past each other horizontally.Depth and location keyThe tremor sent the spire of Christchurch Cathedral, a landmark in the centre of the city, toppling into the square below.John Gurr, a camera technician, told Reuters news agency the area outside the cathedral was \"like a warzone\".Power and telephone lines have been knocked out, while burst pipes have deluged streets with water.The suburbs of Lyttelton and New Brighton are reportedly \"unliveable\".Queen Elizabeth II said in a statement she had been \"utterly shocked\" by the news.\"My thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this dreadful event,\" the statement said.The quake caused some 30m tons of ice to shear away from New Zealand\\'s biggest glacier.Witnesses say massive icebergs formed when the Tasman Glacier in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park broke, tossing a nearby lake with huge waves.Back in Christchurch, emergency shelters were set up in the city\\'s Hagley Park, a race course and schools as night approached.City Mayor Bob Parker told the BBC: \"This is a terrible, terrible toll on our city.\"\"There is no power in most of the city; there is no water in most of the city,\" he added.PM John Key said: \"It is just a scene of utter devastation. We have to work as fast as we can to get people out of environments where they are trapped.\"This is a community that is absolutely in agony. We just need this community, as it has done before and as it will do again, to come together, to check and support one another,\" he added.The military has been deployed to help the rescue effort, and the government has accepted an offer of specialist help from Australia.A series of aftershocks, some as big as magnitude 5, have already rattled the stricken city, and officials warned residents to brace for more.One Christchurch resident, Jaydn Katene, told the New Zealand Herald: \"We\\'ve had friends in town call us and say there are just bodies lying around; lots of dead bodies outside shops just lying there just covered in bricks.\"A British backpacker said the city \"looked like a bomb had hit it\".New Zealand experiences more than 14,000 earthquakes a year, of which only around 20 have a magnitude in excess of 5.0.The last fatal earthquake was in 1968, when a 7.1-magnitude tremor killed three people on the South Island\\'s western coast.Tuesday\\'s was the country\\'s worst natural disaster since a 1931 quake in the North Island city of Napier killed 256 people.\\n', 'The non-league club\\'s ground at Meadow Park was completely submerged by the 2007 floods and they have been unable to play there since.The new ground will be a completely new build, within the boundaries of the old stadium, and will include flood defences.The plans will be submitted to Gloucester County Council next week.Club spokesman Mike Dunstan said: \"We have regularly communicated with residents and can say that this flood defence proposal will give substantial and significant benefits to the residents and businesses of the Sudmeadow area.\"GCFC flood risks consultants have been working on this proposal since 2008 with the EA (Environment Agency) to provide the solution.\"Since 2007 the club has played home games at the grounds of Forest Green Rovers, Cirencester Town and Cheltenham Town.Club chairman Nigel Hughes said: \"I am especially pleased for our supporters who have, throughout this very difficult time, been wonderfully supportive and extremely patient with us.\"There is still much work to be done but this gives us all a big lift and is something to work towards.\"\\n', 'More than a new way of playing video games, a cynic might say.Special Report: The Technology of BusinessDigital death of a business card?Mobile advertisers want your phoneRinsing your reputation the online wayMobile working comes of ageUsing voice to give your app the edgeBut Microsoft - a company that may well spend more on R&D than any other business - believes its strategy is paying off, and the proof is the XBox Kinect system.On a visit to the company\\'s headquarters, I had a chance to see some of the projects that Microsoft scientists at its laboratories in Redmond, in Beijing and in Cambridge, England, believe will change the way we see computers.And the striking thing about what Microsoft\\'s research chief Craig Mundie picked to show off to a group of technology journalists was that almost all of them involved Kinect.The system which turns a player\\'s body into a games controller was developed with the help of seven different research groups at the company\\'s three main labs, some working on voice recognition, others on motion sensors and a range of other technologies.Now they are looking at what Kinect could do next.We saw a system which would allow two people to see different images on the same screen, their eyes tracked by the Kinect camera.Other scientists showed off ways that the camera could capture objects and people in 3D, which might have applications in future telepresence systems.And there was plenty of work on avatars, for use in either games or in video-conferencing. Two Chinese researchers demonstrated a photo-realistic talking head - type in some text and he\\'ll say anything you want, blinking and moving almost like a real person.Craig Mundie says the success of Kinect, which racked up 8m sales in its first 60 days, is proof that the sheer scale of Microsoft\\'s R&D strategy is paying off.\"Microsoft is at a point where many of the things that we\\'ve been researching for twenty years are starting to add up and produce solutions,\" he says. \"You can\\'t rely on two guys in a garage to make all the changes, some of these things require a huge amount of technology and a lot of scale.\"But Microsoft desperately needed a hit from its research labs.Ever since Bill Gates decided 20 years ago that the company would spend big bucks on trying to see into the future, there have been ideas aplenty but few stand out products. A decade ago, for instance, Gates was showing off tablet computers - but it took Apple and its iPad to make them mainstream.Peter Lee, who runs the Redmond lab, says the research operation has a wide remit, from dealing with instant fixes to current products to blue-sky thinking.Professor Lee, who joined Microsoft last year after a distinguished academic career and a spell at the US defence agency DARPA, insists the labs are having an impact  on a daily basis.He cites the contribution to what he describes as the \"holy war in search\", the battle between Google and Microsoft\\'s Bing.\"Hour by hour we have a large group of researchers actively involved in Bing, constantly adding new research advances into the product.\"But he thinks the long-term research is equally important.\"Some call it navel-gazing, we call it pushing back the frontiers of human knowledge,\" he says with a smile, predicting that his lab will one day win a Nobel prize.His boss Craig Mundie is Microsoft\\'s big thinker, charting the path of its future research. His current obsession is what he calls natural user interfaces, new ways of interacting with computers, of which Kinect is one example.There is, he says, a shift about to happen from the old graphical user interface to a trend where \"the computer is more like us - it sees, it listens, it speaks, it understands, it even seeks to do things on our behalf.\"It is an intriguing vision, but here\\'s a sobering fact. All these clever ideas, smart people, and major investment have not stopped Microsoft from being overtaken in the last year in terms of market value by Apple, which seems to focus on the customer experience now, rather than five years down the line.Big, sleepy, and dull, I suggested to Mr Mundie, is how many people now perceive Microsoft.\"We don\\'t feel big and sleepy or dull,\" he responded, \"but if people perceive us that way I think looking at the stuff that Kinect brings should change that view.\"And he insists that firms that do not have the patience to spend on long-term research will lose out in the end.\"I don\\'t think any company is going to prevail over a long period of time in giving good business returns, if they aren\\'t making these kind of investments. They\\'ll come and go in a generation if they don\\'t have the staying power that\\'s produced by having real mastery of the underlying technologies.\"Microsoft, which still generates huge revenues from its core products, Windows and Office, can well afford to keep spending on its blue-sky thinking. But having made such a big bet on science, it will be hoping that the coming years will produce more Kinects, and fewer tablet PCs.\\n', 'A former field marshal, three generals and six admirals say the loss of Ark Royal and its fleet of Harrier jets has damaged Britain\\'s defence capabilities.They say Britain can no longer mount amphibious operations without putting troops\\' lives at \"considerable risk\".Defence Secretary Liam Fox has defended the \"difficult decisions\".The BBC\\'s defence correspondent, Jonathan Beale, said the letter, which was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, raises questions about what military rescue operation forces could mount in the future.In December, Dr Fox announced that the frigate sent to evacuate British nationals from Libya - HMS Cumberland - is to be decommissioned in April, following the strategic defence and security review (SDSR).Our correspondent says this is not the first time former military top brass have warned that recent cuts in the armed forces have left Britain dangerously exposed.Labour has already called for the defence review to be reopened in light of events in Egypt, Bahrain and Libya.The letter - written before the current evacuation operation in Libya - is signed by, among others, Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a former chief of the defence staff; Maj Gen Julian Thompson and Adm Sir Jeremy Black, who commanded the carrier Invincible during the Falklands conflict.Dr Fox insists Britain still has the \"right military assets\" in place to respond to crises.But this group of former military commanders is calling on the prime minister to reassess the decisions made in the defence review.They have called for a re-evaluation of the SDSR, which they say is \"unduly trusting in an uncertain, fast-moving and dangerous world\".However Dr Fox defended the steps taken to tackle the Â£38bn deficit left by Labour and said the review would not be reopened.\"For our future carrier strike capability, it makes strategic sense to move towards greater inter-operability with the US and France and installing catapult and arrestor gear will deliver this.\"Sustaining both Tornado and Harrier would be prohibitively expensive in this current economic climate and Tornado continues to provide vital support to the front line in Afghanistan,\" he said.Referring to Libya, he said Hercules C-130 aircraft had lifted 51 UK citizens to safety on Thursday - and more than 100 were on their way to Malta on HMS Cumberland.\"None of our allies have seen fit to position an aircraft carrier off the coast of Libya as this is not the tool required for this task; there is no requirement for ground attack aircraft, but even if there were we would use our extensive regional basing and overflight rights,\" he said.But shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said: \"The government\\'s plans were based on strategic and international geo-political assumptions, many of which have been shaken over the past month.\"Recent dramatic events mean that the defence review must be reopened and perhaps even rethought. It would be sensible to stop and reflect again on our nation\\'s strategic defence needs.\"\\n', 'Environment Minister Zhou Shengxian said conflict between development and nature had never been so serious.He said if China meant to quadruple the size of its economy over 20 years without more damage, it would have to become more efficient in resource use.Otherwise, he said, there would be a painful price to pay.His comments came ahead of China\\'s annual session of parliament, which opens on 5 March.They also came a day after Premier Wen Jiabao said China was lowering its annual economic growth target from 7.5% to 7%, in part because of its impact on the environment.Mr Zhou\\'s comments came in an essay posted on the website on the Ministry of Environmental Protection.By Shirong ChenBBC China EditorZhou Shengxian wants to see environmental protection become a key plank of the new Five Year Plan (2011-2015) to be debated during the annual session of the National People\\'s Congress.Chinese ministers do not often publish their ideas like this. (It happened nearly two years ago when China\\'s central bank governor published a series of essays on reserve currencies and reform to the international financial system.)The environment minister\\'s statement is an open call for a paradigm shift away from the model of high input, high resource consumption, and high pollution, to sustainable growth to ease the conflict between economic and social development, and the environmental damage it has caused in the past three decades.Chinese scholars say China\\'s energy intensity per unit of GDP is at least five times that of Japan. Social stability is another factor as more people are enraged by worsening air, water and soil pollution.It remains to be seen if his call will be translated into real action as China\\'s economic engine roars ahead.\"In China\\'s thousands of years of civilisation, the conflict between humanity and nature has never been as serious as it is today,\" he wrote.\"The depletion, deterioration and exhaustion of resources and the deterioration of the environment have become serious bottlenecks constraining economic and social development.\"China, he said, would suffer unless issues of air and water pollution were prioritised.He suggested that his ministry should take on a greater role in tackling greenhouse gas emissions and that new development projects  be assessed for their impact on climate change.In recent decades, development has been prioritised over the environment, meaning that China now has some of the most polluted skies and waterways in the world.It relies heavily on coal and is the world\\'s leading CO2 emitter. It overtook the US as the world\\'s biggest car and van market in 2009.In recent years there have been numerous examples of industrial spills or dumping that have damaged waterways and in some cases harmed residents.The BBC\\'s Martin Patience in Beijing says that the government has repeatedly promised to tackle pollution, but then failed to enforced these decisions.\\n']\n",

And commentators say this could pose an impediment to the future expansion of the private forensics market.Some forensic scientists have expressed dismay at the FSS\\'s closure, voicing concerns about the quality of science, the retention of expertise and the future of forensic research and development (R&D) once the service is closed down.In a letter to New Scientist magazine in January, Professor Alec Jeffreys, who pioneered the technique of genetic fingerprinting at the University of Leicester, said the decision to close the FSS could not be in the interests of justice.\"Who will provide the expertise for complex and interdisciplinary investigations, and who will develop and refine new technologies? The private sector is most unlikely to fill this void,\" he wrote.As reported by BBC News last month, Peter Gill, professor of forensic genetics at the University of Oslo, said there was a mismatch between the government\\'s aim to commercialise forensic science and the requirement of courts for openness.He added that UK courts would not accept forensic tests whose details were kept secret due to commercial confidentiality issues.Mr Brokenshire has said that the Forensic Science Regulator should ensure that quality standards are maintained. This course is questioned by Prospect union, which represents scientists and engineers, in their evidence to the inquiry.\"Currently the forensic science regulator sits in the Home Office, but... Prospect understands that there are very limited powers and no statutory influence,\" the union wrote.It added: \"Additional regulatory powers will be needed to ensure that there is a level playing field between police forces and private contractors. It will also be essential to ensure that forensic science practitioners have recognisable and respected qualifications and a professional code of ethics.\"Professor Allan Jamieson, director of the Forensic Institute in Glasgow, which is a commercial supplier of forensic services, said there was \"no reason to expect that, if properly managed, this market cannot deliver the required service at a fair price\".But he highlighted the need for the involvement of the wider scientific community in UK forensic science to prevent it from becoming isolated.\"It cannot be known whether any provider has met the scientific standard if there is no scientific research to measure the standard against,\" he wrote in his submission.\"Perhaps properly funding this essential research is the obvious, logical, and necessary step to prevent the feared decline of standards in forensic science.\"The FSS is headquartered in Birmingham, with a number of laboratories around England and Wales; it has already closed laboratories at Chepstow and central Birmingham to help bring costs under control. The service previously employed about 1,600 staff.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\\n', 'Several decades later it had become, in the words of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, India\\'s \"greatest internal security challenge\".Maoists are also known as \"Naxalites\" because of the violent left-wing uprising in 1967, which began in the West Bengal village of Naxalbari.Although this was eventually quashed by police, over the years India\\'s Maoists have regrouped and asserted control over vast swathes of land in central and eastern India, establishing a so-called \"red corridor\".This spans the states of Jharkand, West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh and also reaches into Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka.The Maoists and affiliated groups are active in more than a third of India\\'s 600-odd districts, the authorities say.And more than 6,000 people have died in the rebels\\' long fight for communist rule in these states.The Maoists\\' military leader is Koteshwar Rao, otherwise known as Kishenji.He reportedly suffered temporary paralysis in June 2010 when a police bullet hit him in the knee.Normally a regular communicator with the press, Kishenji was little heard of until January 2011 when he issued a statement saying he expected India to succumb to a Maoist revolution by 2025.Latest estimates suggest he commandes at least 20,000 armed fighters. They are said to get most of their weapons by raiding police bases.Analysts say the longevity of the Maoist rebellion is partly due to the local support they receive.The rebels say they are fighting for the rights of indigenous tribespeople and the rural poor who they say have been neglected by governments for decades.Maoists claim to represent local concerns over land ownership and equitable distribution of resources.Ultimately they say they want to establish a \"communist society\" by overthrowing India\\'s \"semi-colonial, semi-feudal\" form of rule through armed struggle.The BBC\\'s Subir Bhaumik in Calcutta says that while there is little prospect of them making any headway in urban areas - or indeed non-jungle rural areas - the rebels remain a force to be reckoned with in remote areas where the security forces are thin on the ground.Our correspondent says the key question now is whether to deploy the army against the rebels in the same way it has been used in Indian-administered Kashmir and some north-eastern states.Such a move would be highly controversial, because it would inevitably been seen by some critics as evidence that the rebels are making headway in what is seen by some as \"mainland India\".Over the years the Maoists have managed to launch a series of damaging attacks on Indian security forces.In 2009, rebels gained virtual control of Lalgarh district in West Bengal barely 250km (155 miles) from the state capital, Calcutta.For many months, rebels, supported by local villagers, held hundreds of paramilitary forces at bay. The Maoists declared it to be India\\'s first \"liberated zone\" but Indian security forces finally overwhelmed the rebels.April 2010 saw rebels ambush paramilitary troops in the dense jungles of central Chhattisgarh state, killing at least 76 soldiers. Correspondents say it was the worst-ever Maoist attack on Indian security forces.In 2007, also in Chhattisgarh, Maoist rebels killed 55 policemen in an attack on a remote police outpost.Almost every week, Maoist rebels are blamed for minor skirmishes and incidents across India\\'s north-east - common tactics include blowing up railway tracks and attacking police stations.In 2010, the Maoists faced India\\'s biggest ever anti-Maoist offensive.Nearly 50,000 federal paramilitary troops and tens of thousands of policemen took part in the operation across several states.While the rebels were pushed back deep into their jungle strongholds, they have continued to carry out hit-and-run attacks and numerous high-profile kidnappings.India\\'s government in turn has pledged to crack down even harder unless rebels renounce violence and enter peace talks.At the same time there have been differences not just within the central government over how to tackle the rebellion, but also between Delhi and various Indian states affected by the insurgency.Experts say that disagreements over whether to deploy the army against the rebels is a manifestation of these tensions.On one issue however the analysts remain united - the chances of any kind of meaningful dialogue with the rebels in the foreseeable future are slim.\\n', 'The former Manchester United captain wants to build the futuristic four-bedroom property on greenbelt moorland between Bolton and Bury.The partially-underground house was labelled a \"Teletubbies\" home because of its petal-shaped design.The planning committee approved the development by 12 votes to nine.The application will now be referred to the Government Office for the North West for consideration.The 36-year-old plans to have the kitchen in the flower\\'s stigma, with its petals being bedrooms, bathrooms, a garage, a children\\'s play area and a swimming pool.The planning application was turned down when it went before the planning committee last June.Officers from Bolton Council recommended its approval because of \"its exceptionally high quality of design\" and \"sensitive relationship with the surrounding landscape\".But committee members ignored the report\\'s advice and voted 14-6 to refuse the application.The application was re-submitted with the height of a wind turbine lowered.A council spokeswoman said: \"The committee has approved the plans and the application will now be referred to the Government Office for the North West (GONW) for consideration.\"Should GONW consider it justified the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has the power to intervene, and call in the application for him to consider.\"However, if the scheme is approved by GONW and the scheme is not called in for review, then the application will be referred back to the council.

Also from Spain, Gamesa has opted for Glasgow as a research base, while looking at Dundee for manufacturing and logistic support.The biggest commitment so far is from Doosan Power Systems, a subsidiary of the vast Doosan conglomerate based in South Korea. It is new into the wind turbine business, though it\\'s not new to green energy research, as a partner with Scottish & Southern Energy on early stages of commercialising carbon capture and storage.The research and development centre comes first, with 500 jobs to follow in a turbine manufacturing plant. So far Scotland\\'s only had one such plant, near Campbeltown, and it\\'s had a troubled couple of years, with three owners. So Doosan\\'s statement of intent is a sign that the green jobs potential and hopes may be moving towards reality.The jobs announcements were made by both companies, who were visited by First Minister Alex Salmond.Doosan intends to locate its research and development centre for renewables at its current site at Westway in Renfrew, creating up to 200 jobs.The Korean firm is also in talks with the business development agency, Scottish Enterprise, to set up manufacturing and assembly facilities in Scotland - its favoured location for wind turbine development and production.Doosan expects its offshore wind plans in Scotland to create up to 1,700 new jobs.The firm aims to directly recruit about 700 new staff, with a further 1,000 employed in associated supply companies.In a separate announcement, Steel Engineering, which is also based at Westway in Renfrew, said it aimed to create 120 jobs by expanding its business servicing a range of clean energy sectors, including offshore wind, wave and tidal power.The firm is getting a Â£1.8m government grant towards the Â£3m investment.Steel Engineering is also in talks with Skills Development Scotland about developing a training school with Anniesland College in Glasgow.This would aim to provide training tailored to the latest fabrication techniques, and welding procedures required by the renewables industry.Mr Salmond said both announcements were \"great news for Renfrew and for the wider Scottish economy\".He described the Doosan initiatives as \"another great stride forward for the renewables industry in Scotland - which is now the chosen destination for three energy engineering giants to design their next generation of turbines to service the global offshore wind industry\".The first minister added: \"Scotland also plays a key role in the energy industry supply chain and Steel Engineering are an excellent example of how Scottish companies with great experience servicing the offshore oil and gas industry have been building the renewables side of their business.\"\\n', 'Three fire engines were called to Railway Street, Tunstall, at about 2320 GMT on Tuesday.Crews brought the fire in the lounge under control within half an hour.

Dissident republicans have been blamedSource: BBC News reports (court cases and incidents south of the border not included)\\n', 'The uprising is now regarded in Kenya as one of the most significant steps towards a Kenya free from British rule.The Mau Mau fighters were mainly drawn from Kenya\\'s major ethnic grouping, the Kikuyu.More than a million strong, by the start of the 1950s the Kikuyu had been increasingly economically marginalised as years of white settler expansion ate away at their land holdings.Since 1945, nationalists like Jomo Kenyatta of the Kenya African Union (KAU) had been pressing the British government in vain for political rights and land reforms, with valuable holdings in the cooler Highlands to be redistributed to African owners.But radical activists within the KAU set up a splinter group and organised a more militant kind of nationalism.By 1952 Kikuyu fighters, along with some Embu and Meru recruits, were attacking political opponents and raiding white settler farms and destroying livestock. Mau Mau supporters took oaths, binding them to their cause.In October 1952 the British declared a state of emergency and began moving army reinforcements into Kenya.So began an aggressively fought counter-insurgency, which lasted until 1960 when the state of emergency was ended.The number killed in the uprising is a subject of much controversy. Officially the number of Mau Mau and other rebels killed was 11,000, including 1,090 convicts hanged by the British administration. Just 32 white settlers were killed in the eight years of emergency.However, unofficial figures suggest a much larger number were killed in the counter-insurgency campaign.The Kenya Human Rights Commission has said 90,000 Kenyans were executed, tortured or maimed during the crackdown, and 160,000 were detained in appalling conditions.David Anderson, professor of African Politics at Oxford University, says he estimates the death toll in the conflict to have been as high as 25,000.He said: \"Everything that could happen did happen. Allegations about beatings and violence were widespread. Basically you could get away with murder. It was systematic.\"The African Home Guard, recruited by the British, used oppressive violence as a means of controlling the population, Prof Anderson suggests.He said: \"The British armed the militia, rewarded them, incentivised them, allowing them to pillage property of the nationalists.\"Mau Mau families were subject to pillage by their neighbours. People would simply walk up to the farm and walk away with things.\"In addition to search-and-destroy missions against Mau Mau fighter bands operating in the forests, the British also strategically resettled Kikuyu in villages. They also detained some 100,000 Kikuyu without trial, often for periods of between three and seven years.London law firm Leigh Day & Co lodged a claim in mid-2009 on behalf of five elderly Kenyans. One has died since the case was lodged.The firm says its clients suffered terribly in detention camps or at the hands of British-led soldiers.Solicitor Martyn Day told the BBC: \"They were put in camps where they were subject to severe torture, malnutrition, beatings. The women were sexually assaulted. Two of the men were castrated. The most severe gruesome torture you could imagine.\"A lot of the officers involved were white, they were controlling the violence against these Mau Mau. It wasn\\'t just isolated individual officers. It was systematic. The whole purpose was to break the Mau Mau.\"The UK says the claim is not valid because of the amount of time since the abuses were alleged to have happened, and that any liability rested with the Kenyan authorities after independence in 1963.But Leigh Day & Co says the case is an \"opportunity for the British government to come to terms with the past and apologise to the victims and the Kenyan people for this grave historic wrong\".South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu has backed their case.\"In my view, the British government\\'s attempt to pin liability on Kenya for British colonial torture represents an intolerable abdication of responsibility,\" he said.\"Britain\\'s insistence that international human rights standards should be respected by governments around the world will sound increasingly hollow if the door is shut in the face of these known victims of British torture.\"But it is clear that brutal violence was exacted on both sides.Prof Anderson explains: \"There was lots of suffering on the other side too. This was a dirty war. It became a civil war - though that idea remains extremely unpopular in Kenya today.\"One example was the Mau Mau raid on the \"loyalist\" village of Lari, where the majority of the men were away fighting with the British Home Guard. The rebels killed more than 70, mostly women and children.Tim Simmonds, who joined the Kenyan police reserve as a tracker shortly after settling in Kenya in 1954, says the Mau Mau fighters \"went on the rampage\", slaughtering thousands of people, leaving him so frightened he slept under his bed for a year.While deploring the treatment of detainees in the camps, he says he has no regrets about fighting the insurgents in the bush.\"They really got what they deserved. I\\'m really quite tough on this. If I had the chance again in the same situation, them killing people, would I go out and kill them again as I did? Yes sir I would.\"It has long been suggested that the suppression of the Mau Mau was more brutal in nature than the action taken against other colonial uprisings across the British Empire.Some historians have posited that white settler pressure on the British government and the characterisation of the Mau Mau fighters as the epitome of savagery may have been behind this.The Kikuyu themselves were split, with \"haves\" often siding with the British against Mau Mau \"have-nots\" and many happy to take the confiscated land of their fellow villagers.Prof Anderson notes that one of the things marking the battle against the Mau Mau was the number of hangings, with capital offences extended during the emergency to include \"consorting\" with Mau Mau.Some attention was paid to allegations of atrocities at the time, with questions asked in parliament about 11 Africans beaten to death in a British camp at Hola.Among those who spoke out were the Labour MP Barbara Castle and the Conservative Enoch Powell, now best known for his \"rivers of blood\" speech.He suggested at the time that if such killings were to go unpunished Britain did not deserve an empire.\"I would say it is a fearful doctrine, which must recoil upon the heads of those who pronounce it, to stand in judgment on a fellow human being and say, \\'Because he was such-and-such, therefore the consequences which would otherwise flow from his death shall not flow.\\'\"Even though the Mau Mau were thoroughly defeated by 1960, the exact reforms that nationalists had been pressing for before the uprising had started and, by 1963, Kenya was independent.\\n', \"Many of the elements that make up the foundation of the modern world originated in China, including paper, gunpowder, credit banking, the compass and paper money.China stagnated for more than two decades under the rigid Communist rule of the founder of the People's Republic, Mao Zedong.But China now has the world's fastest-growing economy and is undergoing what has been described as a second industrial revolution.It has also launched an ambitious space exploration programme, involving plans to set up a space station by 2020.The People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949 after the Communist Party defeated the previously dominant nationalist Kuomintang in a civil war.The Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, creating two rival Chinese states - the PRC on the mainland and the Republic of China based on Taiwan.China profile - homeCountry profiles - homeCountry profiles compiled by BBC MonitoringBeijing says the island of Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory that must be reunited with the mainland.The claim has in the past led to tension and threats of invasion, but since 2008 the two governments have moved towards a more cooperative atmosphere.The leadership of Mao Zedong oversaw the often brutal implementation of a Communist vision of society.Millions died in the Great Leap Forward - a programme of state control over agriculture and rapid industrialisation - and the Cultural Revolution, a chaotic attempt to root out elements seen as hostile to Communist rule.However, Mao's death in 1976 ushered in a new leadership and economic reform. In the early 1980s the government dismantled collective farming and again allowed private enterprise.The rate of economic change has not been matched by political reform, with the Communist Party - the world's largest political party - retaining its monopoly on power and maintaining strict control over the people.The authorities still crack down on any signs of opposition and send outspoken dissidents to labour camps.Nowadays China is one of the world's top exporters and is attracting record amounts of foreign investment. In turn, it is investing billions of dollars abroad.The collapse in international export markets that accompanied the global financial crisis of 2009 initially hit China hard, but its economy was among the first in the world to rebound, quickly returning to growth.In February 2011 it formally overtook Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, though by early 2012 the debt crisis in the eurozone - one of the biggest markets for Chinese goods - was beginning to act as a drag on China's growth.As a member of the World Trade Organisation, China benefits from access to foreign markets. But relations with trading partners have been strained over China's huge trade surplus and the piracy of goods.The former has led to demands for Beijing to raise the value of its currency, the renminbi, which would make Chinese goods more expensive for foreign buyers and possibly hold back exports. Beijing has responded with a gradual easing of restrictions on trading in the currency.Some Chinese fear that the rise of private enterprise and the demise of state-run industries carries heavy social costs such as unemployment and instability.Moreover, the fast-growing economy has fuelled the demand for energy. China is the largest oil consumer after the US, and the world's biggest producer and consumer of coal. It spends billions of dollars in pursuit of foreign energy supplies. There has been a massive investment in hydro-power, including the $25bn Three Gorges Dam project.The economic disparity between urban China and the rural hinterlands is among the largest in the world. In recent decades many impoverished rural dwellers have flocked to the country's eastern cities, which have enjoyed a construction boom.By the beginning of 2012, city dwellers appeared to outnumber the rural population for the first time, according to official figures.Social discontent manifests itself in protests by farmers and workers. Tens of thousands of people travel to Beijing each year to lodge petitions with the authorities in the hope of finding redress for alleged corruption, land seizures and evictions.Other pressing problems include corruption, which affects every level of society, and the growing rate of HIV infection. A downside of the economic boom has been environmental degradation; China is home to many of the world's most-polluted cities.Human rights campaigners continue to criticise China for executing hundreds of people every year and for failing to stop torture, as well as for continuing to censor political and artistic expression.The country is keen to stamp down on what it sees as dissent among its ethnic minorities, including Muslim Uighurs in the north-west.Chinese rule over Tibet is controversial. Human rights groups accuse the authorities of the systematic destruction of Tibetan Buddhist culture and the persecution of monks loyal to the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader who is campaigning for autonomy within China.\\n\", 'Peter Gillespie, 64, from Hertfordshire, was part of a £4.7m plot to bring two million doses of counterfeit drugs from China to the UK.He was convicted of conspiring to defraud pharmaceutical wholesalers, pharmacists and members of the public.He was convicted by a jury at Croydon Crown Court.By mimicking authentic, properly manufactured and tested medicines, Gillespie illegally infiltrated the regulated system designed to protect the public and pharmaceutical industry, the court heard.The counterfeit medicines contained only a fraction of the correct dosage.They included Zyprexa, a medicine to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.Andrew Marshall, prosecuting, said patients had been put at risk by his fraud.\"This case is considered to represent the most serious breach of the medicine control regime - it\\'s the most serious breach that has happened in the EU,\" he told jurors.\"It has had far-reaching effects for the pharmaceutical industry, control mechanisms, patients and the confidence of the public.\"The case arose from a £750,000 three-and-a-half-year investigation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).Mick Deats, head of enforcement, said after the trial that 72,000 packs of counterfeit medicine - with a retail value of £4.7m - penetrated the UK supply chain between December 2006 and May 2007.Some 25,000 of these packs reached pharmacies and were given to patients.The MHRA was able to seize 40,000 before they got to pharmacies, and 7,000 were recovered following recalls.Although the drugs contained just 50% to 80% of the correct ingredients, Mr Deats did not believe they caused any fatalities or adverse reactions.At Croydon Crown Court, Gillespie, of High Street, Bovingdon, was also found guilty of selling or supplying drugs without a marketing authorisation  between January 2006 and June 2007.Jurors also found him guilty of a charge of acting as a company director while disqualified.Mr Deats added the MHRA now hoped to seize anything Gillespie obtained through his scam in a proceeds of crime hearing.Four other men - his brother Ian, 59, of The Green, Marsh Baldon, Oxfordshire; Richard Kemp, 61, of School Lane, Y Waen, Flint, north Wales; Ian Harding, 58, of Lower Westwood, Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire; and James Quinn, 70, of Virginia Park, Virginia Water, Surrey - were acquitted of all charges.Another person connected to the case had already been convicted in the US.\\n', 'However his role as used-car salesman Arthur Daley, in the long-running TV series Minder, is the one for which he will be best remembered.His character became synonymous with dodgy dealing and phrases such as \"nice little earner\" and \"er indoors\" passed  into the national lexicon.As well as his numerous screen appearances, he also starred for 15 years in the BBC radio series A Life of Bliss, later adapted for TV.George Edward Cole was born in Tooting, south-west London  on 22 Apr 1925. His 16 year old mother abandoned him when he was just ten days old and he was adopted by the Cole family and  brought up on a London council estate.He left school at 14 intending to work as a butcher\\'s boy but,  following the death of his adoptive father, ran away to Blackpool where he successfully auditioned for a part in a touring musical show.In 1940, he played a Cockney evacuee in Cottage To Let, first on stage and then on film. He had gone to the audition for the stage version purely to accompany a friend but ended up getting the part himself.\"I was always in plays at school and in school concerts,\" he said. \"You could say I liked to show off.\"Together with his adoptive mother, he was taken in by the  actor Alistair Sim and his wife, Naomi, and appeared with Sim in a number of plays.The Sims ruthlessly worked on ironing out his cockney vowels, determined that he shouldn\\'t be type-cast.Cole joined the RAF in 1943, where he trained as a wireless operator. When it was discovered that his eyesight wasn\\'t good he was removed from flying duties and transferred to Coastal Command HQ in Northwood before going to Allied occupied Germany to run the bar in an officers\\' mess.After the war he returned to acting and, by his late 20s, was a veteran of more than 30 films, few of them memorable, including a role as the love interest of a newly-emerging starlet called Joan Collins, in the 1951 film Bikini Babe.He did have a small role in Laurence Olivier\\'s epic production of Henry V and was, at the time of his death, the last survivor of the huge cast.In 1953, he took over the role of David Bliss, the somewhat bumbling bachelor in the BBC radio comedy, A Life of Bliss. The series ran for 118 episodes, transferring briefly to television in the early 1960s.It was the 1954 film, The Belles of St Trinian\\'s that brought him to the attention of a  wider audience and, incidentally, allowed him to establish the character of the cockney rogue that he would later portray in Minder.As the spiv, Flash Harry, he was a ready source of nylons for the girls in the school and drink for the teachers. The film featured his mentor, Alistair Sim in the dual roles of the headmistress and her crooked brother.He would go on to reprise the role in Blue Murder at St Trinian\\'s in 1957, Blue Murder at St Trinian\\'s in 1960 and The Great St Trinian\\'s Train Robbery in 1966.He was seldom out of work, proving to be a versatile performer who could turn his hand to serious roles, as in The Inspector Calls and musicals like It\\'s a Wonderful World.There was a minor role in the Taylor/Burton version of Cleopatra in 1963 and he even turned his hand to horror in the 1970s, with The Vampire Lovers, which shocked many with its lesbian love scenes.The following year, in another horror film, Fright, he found himself working alongside a young actor named Dennis Waterman - later to star alongside him in Minder.Cole was also shortlisted for the part of the butler, Hudson, in the London Weekend period drama, Upstairs, Downstairs, a role that eventually went to Gordon Jackson.He remained much in demand appearing in a variety of roles. These included playing the  potter, Josiah Wedgewood in a BBC drama, The Voyage of Charles Darwin and the unscrupulous MP, Sir Giles Lynchwood, in the BBC adaptation of Tom Sharpe\\'s novel, Blott on the Landscape.In one scene of the latter production his character, a secret fetishist,  was left naked, trussed and bound on a bed by a  good natured, but particularly forgetful call girl, memorably played by Julia McKenzie.He also played the author, George Maple, in the BBC sitcom, Don\\'t Forget to WriteIn 1979 he was offered the part of Arthur Daley in a comedy-drama called Minder, a role that would come to define his career.The character reflected the entrepreneurial era of Thatcher\\'s Britain. \"In an era of greed, he was fairly greedy, but also so unsuccessful,\" Cole once recalled. \"He had the appeal of the eternal loser.\"Originally written as a vehicle for Dennis Waterman, Cole was not the first choice for the part but Waterman\\'s preference for the actor, Denholm Eliot, was overruled by the producers, much to Waterman\\'s annoyance.\"We circled round each other for three or four days,\" Cole later recalled. But the pair soon became close friends and developed a rapport on set that saw them improvising scenes to good effect.The drama ran for eleven series, with Gary Webster replacing Dennis Waterman as Terry in 1991, and delivered huge ratings figures for ITV.It also made Cole an unlikely pop star when  his duet with Dennis Waterman, \"What Are We Gonna Get \\'Er Indoors?\", reached the UK Top Thirty in 1983.Although Cole was approaching 70 when Minder finally ended, he continued to work regularly into the new century with guest appearances in a number of series, including Midsomer Murders, and various film roles.He married the actress Eileen Moore in 1954 and the couple had two children. They divorced in 1962 after she left him for someone else. Cole subsequently married another actress, Penny MorrellA genial and warm-hearted man, Cole always had mixed feelings about the wheeler-dealer character that had brought him fame and fortune.\"I\\'ve earned a few sovs from him over the years, so I shouldn\\'t complain, but he was a rogue; a dreadful character, really. I\\'d certainly lock up the silver if he was coming to dinner.\"\\n', 'A working reactor caught fire, explosively. Radioactive debris was sent 30,000 feet into the air - the height at which airliners conventionally fly.Some of that debris came down thousands of kilometres away, in concentrations strong enough to prohibit the eating of meat and the drinking of milk produced locally.The upgrading of Japan\\'s Fukushima incident to a level seven - the maximum - on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) puts it on a par with Chernobyl.And a spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which runs the plant, suggested it could even end up being worse than Chernobyl.This, though, appears to be a minority view among engineers - both those who generally support nuclear power, and those who have in the past voiced criticisms.Timeline: nuclear accidents\"The classification of seven means there\\'s a leak of radiation into the wider environment; and although it\\'ll be interpreted as being \\'the same as Chernobyl\\', it\\'s not the same,\" said Paddy Regan, professor of    physics at the UK\\'s University of Surrey.\"The amount of radiation release is a lot less, and the way it\\'s released is very different.\"The Chernobyl fire was putting lots of radioactive material into the atmosphere and taking it over large distances; here, there have been a couple of releases where they\\'ve vented [gas from] the reactor, and then released some cooling water.\"Don Higson, a retired Australian nuclear safety specialist, was more pithy.\"To my mind, [rating Fukushima equivalent to Chernobyl] would be nonsense,\" he said.In the month following the Chernobyl explosion, he said, 134 workers were hospitalised with acute radiation sickness and 31 died.The equivalent figures for Fukushima are none and none. (Although workers have been taken to hospital with radiation burns, this is not the same as acute radiation sickness.)So why the uprating?What it does not mean is that things have got worse at the plant; in fact, conditions appear to be markedly more stable than in the days following the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, although not completely under control.Rather, Japan\\'s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) has re-analysed data from the incident and decided that collectively the releases of radioactivity mean it slots into a level seven categorisation.The manual for agencies using the INES scale, published by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), runs to 218 pages.One of the criteria for evaluating the severity of an incident is the total release of radioactive material.This is derived by first adding up the amounts of each different radioactive isotope released, then multiplying each by a conversion factor related to the characteristics of that particular isotope, then adding up all of the resulting numbers.Radioactivity is measured in becquerels (Bq); a million million of these is a terabecquerel (TBq).A level seven rating is defined as \"An event resulting in an environmental release corresponding to a quantity of radioactivity radiologically equivalent to a release to the atmosphere of more than several tens of thousands of TBq of Iodine-131.\"NISA puts the Fukushima figure at 370,000 TBq of Iodine-131 equivalent; the Nuclear Safety Commission, which has a more over-arching role in the Japanese system, says 630,000 TBq.Either way, it\\'s clearly beyond the threshold for classification as an INES level seven event, although an order of magnitude lower than the 5.2 million TBq released from Chernobyl.But that tells you nothing about the danger to people.Becquerels are a measure of the rate of radioactive decay; if one atomic nucleus decays per second, that is defined as one becquerel.By contrast, sieverts - another unit commonly used during the last month\\'s reporting - measure the likely medical impact of the radiation to which an individual is exposed.And a huge number of becquerels does not automatically translate into a huge amount of sieverts.\"It\\'s hard to make a comparison between Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima because the radioactive release is different and so is the population,\" said John Large, a UK-based independent nuclear engineer.\"In Ukraine and Belorussia (now Belarus) it was primarily a rural population, whereas in Japan you\\'ve got a highly sophisticated public living in fairly dense population groups.\"And the way the state intervenes is different. With Chernobyl, loads of workers were brought in with no concern for their health - but Japan\\'s a democracy.\"In some quarters, Japan\\'s swift decision to establish an exclusion zone, initiate monitoring of people and food, and dispense iodine tablets has received praise - and the volume of advice and warnings issued to the public has been very different from the silence that pertained after Chernobyl, despite criticisms from other quarters over the quality and timing of some of the Japanese advice.Nuclear experts are cautioning, however, that the situation at Fukushima is still very much in play.Where most attention has centred on reactors 1, 2 and 3, there is also concern about the spent fuel pond in reactor building 4.In the week following the tsunami, it became clear that the pond was running dry, meaning that fuel rods would have heated up.This meant likely degradation of their zirconium alloy cladding, the possible release of hydrogen, and - by Tepco\\'s admission - the risk that a nuclear chain reaction could begin.\"The potential for atmospheric release is very large, with 250 tonnes of material sitting in that pond,\" said Dr Large.\"If you were to have an energetic event you could have a very large release indeed.\"The priority is, as it has been all along, to restore adequate coolant to the fuel ponds and the reactors themselves - while hoping that earthquake aftershocks and bad weather do not hamper operations any more.\\n']\n",

The law forbids reporting on matters that could \"undermine national security, public order or the economy\".Some key dates in Burundi\\'s history:1890 - The kingdoms of Urundi and neighbouring Ruanda (Rwanda) incorporated into German East Africa.1916 - Belgian army occupies the area.1962 - Urundi is separated from Ruanda-Urundi and becomes independent.1993 - Ethnic conflict claims some 300,000 lives.2015 - Unrest sparked by president\\'s plans to stand for third term.\\n', 'Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) aims to reduce radiation leaks in three months and to cool the reactors within nine months.The firm said it also planned to cover the reactor building.Nearly 14,000 people died and another 14,000 are still unaccounted for after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March.Tepco unveiled its roadmap as Hillary Clinton briefly visited Tokyo to pledge America\\'s \"steadfast support\" for Japan\\'s reconstruction.Radiation levels in the sea near reactor 2 rose to 6,500 times the legal limit on Friday, up from 1,100 times a day earlier, Tepco has said, raising fears of fresh radiation leaks.Tsunehisa Katsumata, the chairman of Tepco, Asia\\'s largest utility, told a news conference in Tokyo on Sunday they would need up to nine months to bring the power plant to \\'\\'cold shutdown\\'\\'.He said the plan would allow the tens of thousands of families evacuated from the area around the facility to return home as soon as possible.\"We sincerely apologise for causing troubles,\" Mr Katsumata said. \"We are doing our utmost to prevent the crisis from further worsening.\"Tepco said after cold shutdown it would focus on encasing the reactor buildings, cleaning up contaminated soil and removing nuclear fuel.Japan\\'s government had ordered Tepco to come up with a timetable to end the crisis, now rated on a par with the world\\'s worst nuclear accident, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.But the BBC\\'s Roland Buerk in Tokyo says it is still not certain that the nine-month deadline can be achieved.He says the immediate priority for Tepco is to stop radioactive water leaking into the Pacific Ocean.The utility said it was sending remote-controlled robots into one of the reactors on Sunday to gauge radiation and temperature levels.UK defence contractor QinetiQ said it had provided the machines, which are directed by controllers usually supplied with games consoles.The robots can carry out tasks such as rubble clearance, demolition and radiation testing.Japan is a world leader in such technology, but its robots are not adapted for dirty work such as meltdowns at nuclear plants, experts say.Emergency workers have been unable to enter any reactor building since the disaster.Our correspondent says Japan\\'s recovery bill has been estimated at $300bn (Â£184bn) - already the most expensive disaster in history.But the government said last week that figure might be an underestimate.Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Clinton said in Japan she believed the country would emerge stronger from its worst crisis since World War II.She met Prime Minister Naoto Kan and had tea with Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace, said to be a rare privilege for a non-head of state on a Sunday.America has won Japanese admiration for sending scores of US ships and aircraft as well as 20,000 troops to help the relief effort.Operation Tomodachi, or Friend, was the biggest humanitarian mission the US has conducted in Japan.Before the quake, the two nations\\' ties had been strained by a dispute over US military bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.Mr Kan\\'s predecessor as premier quit last year after being accused of reneging on a promise to remove at least one of the bases.\\n', 'A YouGov survey suggested low name recognition of councillors across the UK, with 79% of East Midlands residents unable to name a single representative.Satisfaction with the work of councils is highest in North East England - but still less than one in three are happy.People have rated councils better than national government in past studies.Voters will go to the polls on 5 May to elect more than 9,500 councillors in nearly 280 councils across England.Research by polling firm YouGov, designed to coincide with the election campaign, has suggested that the majority of voters casting their ballots next month will do so not knowing any of the candidates.It asked more than 2,000 people aged over 18 across the UK whether they could name any of their local councillors.Recognition was highest in Scotland, where 47% of those canvassed were able to identify one of their local representatives. In Northern Ireland, the figure was 46%, while in Wales, the figure was 44%.Across the English regions, recognition was highest in the North East of England - at 43%. But in six regions - the East Midlands, the East of England, the West Midlands, London, the south west of England and the south east - less than one in three of those asked could identify the person representing them.Asked whether the local authority addressed the needs of their local communities, only 20% of people living in the North West of England said it did. Approval levels were highest in the North East (31%), the West Midlands (28%) and Wales (27%).Social networking site Streetlife, which commissioned the research, suggested it demonstrated there was a \"real disconnection\" between residents of local communities and those representing them.The findings contrast with those of the Hansard Society, whose recent audit of political engagement concluded that awareness and satisfaction with local politics had increased since last year\\'s general election.It found that more than two out of three people were interested in how local services were provided and nearly half believed they were being delivered well - much higher than at a national level.The Hansard Society also found name recognition was also a problem for national politicians, with only 38% of people able to name their own MP.But its research suggested that interest in local politics did not translate into a wish to become involved - with only one in ten people saying their were likely to volunteer in their communities over the next couple of years.Elections are taking place next month in 36 metropolitan boroughs, including Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds and Sheffield, as well as 49 unitary authorities and 194 district councils - the biggest test of popular opinion since last year\\'s general election.David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have all been campaigning in recent days to try and garner support.\\n', 'An older generation of practitioners had traditionally relied on a long-established formula, performing illusions that were often mysterious but lacking in spontaneity and humour.Daniels brought a chirpy, cheeky persona to his act - albeit one which was not to everyone\\'s taste - which seemed to thrive on close contact with his audience.Modern technology allowed TV cameras to home in on the close magic at which he excelled, yet on a larger scale, his illusions - most of which he devised himself -  broke new ground in terms of complexity and sophistication.He was born Newton Edward Daniels in the South Bank area of Middlesbrough on 6 April 1938. His father worked as a projectionist at the local Hippodrome Theatre.His interest in magic was sparked when he read a book entitled How to Entertain at Parties and he began practising tricks for his family and friends before performing in local youth clubs.There was an added bonus in that, as a small and shy child, he finally had a skill that would boost his confidence and make people take notice of him.\"From that moment,\" he later said, \"I can safely say that all I ever wanted to do in life was to become a professional magician.\"After leaving grammar school, the young Daniels found a job as a junior clerk in the treasury department of the local council.He did his national service with the Green Howards, a regiment with close connections to the north-east of England. He found himself posted to Hong Kong, where he continued to hone his skills as a magician by giving impromptu performances to fellow soldiers.After he was demobbed, he began training as an accountant before joining his parents in a small grocery business. Eventually he set up his own mobile shop.But magic remained his abiding interest and his evenings were spent performing in local variety clubs. After marrying Jacqueline Skipworth in 1960, the couple often performed together as The Eldanis, an anagram of his surname.Northern club audiences had a reputation for being somewhat unforgiving and prone to heckle performers who, in their opinion, did not come up to the mark.According to Daniels, it was abuse from one heckler in Bradford that made him come up with the retort: \"You\\'ll like this - not a lot, but you\\'ll like it,\" which would become his catchphrase.He developed his style of patter as a way of keeping the audience entertained and as a useful diversion when he had to perform a particularly tricky sleight of hand.His breakthrough came in 1969 when he was offered a summer season in Newquay. He sold his grocery shop and became a full-time entertainer.After an appearance on the talent show Opportunity Knocks, Daniels caught the eye of Johnny Hamp, a senior executive with Granada Television who gave him a regular slot on The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club, a variety show compered by Bernard Manning and set in a fictional working men\\'s club.In 1978, ITV gave him his own Sunday night television show and, the following year, he moved to the BBC with the Paul Daniels Magic Show, which ran for 15 years.As well as performing his own tricks, Daniels had a segment of the show known as the Bunco Booth, in which he exposed the underhand methods used by street confidence tricksters. A 1985 Easter edition of his show won the prestigious Golden Rose of Montreux.By this time, he was in both a professional and personal relationship with the woman who became his on-stage assistant, the former ballerina Debbie McGee. The couple, who had first worked together during a 1979 summer season in Great Yarmouth, married in 1988.At the peak of his fame, he also hosted a number of other television series including the quiz shows Odd One Out, Every Second Counts and Wipeout, and the children\\'s television programme Wizbit.There was controversy in 1987 when Daniels performed, on live TV, a recreation of a Harry Houdini trick in which he was chained inside a replica of a medieval iron maiden, an instrument of torture. He had to escape before the door swung fully shut to avoid being impaled on spikes.When Daniels failed to appear, the screen cut to black, giving the impression the trick had gone badly wrong. The BBC\\'s phone lines were jammed with calls from viewers, whose concern turned to complaints when it was all revealed to be a hoax. Daniels hadn\\'t even warned family members who had been watching.He was bitter when the BBC failed to renew his contract but continued to work in the theatre. There was a six-week run in The Magic Man in London\\'s West End in 1994 and he created and staged special effects for hit shows such as Phantom of the Opera.He often seemed more relaxed on the stage, where he saw himself as an actor, performing what seemed to be the impossible. He preferred to describe himself as a conjuror than a magician.Daniels and his wife took part in a programme in the series When Louis Met... in which documentary maker Louis Theroux delved into the lives of celebrities with a mocking wit.He was also mercilessly lampooned on the satirical puppet show Spitting Image, in which his wig would rise up from his head and spin around on its own.McGee herself became a target of comedian Caroline Aherne\\'s Mrs Merton character, who memorably asked her: \"What first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?\". It became one of television\\'s most popular one-liners.Daniels was outspoken in his political views and took a strong line on law and order, once publicly offering to help Ian Huntley, convicted of the Soham schoolgirl murders, to end his own life.Three years ago at the height of the Jimmy Savile revelations he recalled being routinely offered sex earlier in his career and admitted he couldn\\'t be sure all the women he\\'d slept with were over 16.He also had little truck with younger illusionists such as David Blaine, saying: \"If people were better educated in the world of magic, he would have greater difficulty than he\\'s having. He\\'s not very original.\"If public tastes in TV magicians had changed from Daniels\\' heyday in the 70s and 80s, he did not let it affect his profile on British TV.In 2004, he and McGee appeared in the Channel 5 reality TV show The Farm and, two years later, they appeared in the X Factor: Battle of the Stars.They were the first act voted off the show, after singing Let Me Entertain You by Robbie Williams.In 2010, Daniels also appeared on the eighth series of BBC One\\'s Strictly Come Dancing, where he was paired with Ola Jordan.He was the second celebrity voted off, following DJ and actor Goldie.Of his experience on the show, he told the Daily Mirror: \"It got rid of my inhibitions. That\\'s a good thing that came out of Strictly.\"Debbie and I renewed our vows the other week and, for the first time in 22 and a half years, I danced properly with her.\"\\n', 'Hawick Knitwear, which employs more than 230 staff, has also increased its production of sweaters to meet demand.Production has been boosted by better than expected sales of the Hawick Knitwear-branded range which launched in January.The company, which dates back to 1874, was bought by managing director Benny Hartop in November last year.As well as the new range, the firm has seen growth of its longer-established business of supplying customers who sell the garments under their private labels.In Europe, Hawick Knitwear sells into Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain.Markets outside Europe include the USA, Canada, Mexico, and Japan.The knitwear firm has increased its production to 9,500 sweaters each week, from about 7,500 last year, to keep up with demand.Mr Hartop said: \"The increase in production is in direct response to a surge in orders from both home and abroad for our private label clients and now for our own brand too.\"There will always be challenges but thankfully our future is looking very good and this is a testament to the dedicated staff working at all levels of the business.\"I have no doubt this success will continue for us into the future.\"\\n', 'Quite simply, if the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. If it is negative it is contracting.And two consecutive three-month periods of contraction mean an economy is in recession.GDP can be measured in three ways:In theory all three approaches should produce the same number.In the UK the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes one single measure of GDP which, apart from the first estimate, is calculated using all three ways of measuring.Usually the main interest in the UK figures is in the quarterly change in GDP in real terms, that is after taking into account changes in prices (inflation).Calculating a GDP estimate for all three measures is a huge undertaking every three months.The output measure alone - which is considered the most accurate in the short term - involves surveying tens of thousands of UK firms.The main sources used for this are ONS surveys of manufacturing and service industries.Information on sales is collected from 6,000 companies in manufacturing, 25,000 service sector firms, 5,000 retailers and 10,000 companies in the construction sector.Data is also collected from government departments covering activities such as agriculture, energy, health and education.The UK produces the earliest estimate of GDP of the major economies, around 25 days after the quarter in question.This provides policymakers with an early, or \"flash\", estimate of the real growth in economic activity. It is quick, but only based on the output measure.At that stage only about 40% of the data is available, so this figure is revised as more information comes in.They are two subsequent revisions at monthly intervals. But this isn\\'t the end.Revisions can be made as much as 18 months to two years after the first \"flash\" estimate. The ONS publishes more information on how this is done  on its website.GDP is the principal means of determining the health of the UK economy and is used by the Bank of England and its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) as one of the key indicators in setting interest rates.So, for example, if prices are rising too fast, the Bank would be expected to increase interest rates to try to control them. But it may hold off if GDP growth is sluggish, as higher rates could damage the recovery. That is the situation at the moment.The Treasury also uses GDP when planning economic policy. When an economy is contracting, tax receipts tend to fall, and the government adjusts its tax and spending plans accordingly.UK GDP is used internationally by the various financial bodies such as OECD, IMF, and the World Bank to compare the performance of different economies.The European Union also uses GDP estimates as a basis for determining different countries\\' contributions to the EU budget.The information in this article was provided by the Office for National Statistics.\\n', 'But his killing in an air strike is a grievous strategic error - militarily insignificant but diplomatically disastrous.Towards the end of April, Nato states made a number of operational innovations. Three member states - Britain, France, and Italy - injected military advisers into rebel-held eastern Libya. Another, the US, began continuous patrols of armed drones.Third, and most important, air strikes began to target command, control, communications and intelligence networks (known, in military parlance, as C3I). The Bab al-Aziziya compound includes all three such networks, and it was presumed that their disruption would disorient regime soldiers on the front line, cut off field commanders from Tripoli, and sow confusion in the ranks.But was the strike also an assassination attempt?Assassination of a head of state is illegal under international law, and forbidden by various US presidential orders. On the other hand, the targeted killing of those woven into the enemy chain of command is shrouded in legal ambiguity.Given the personalistic nature of the regime, and the \"all means necessary\" clause in UN Resolution 1973, it might be argued that killing Col Muammar Gaddafi and certain members of his family - such as his son Khamis, commander of an elite military brigade - would be permissible, even if it posed a risk to those non-combatants around the regime.Legality, though, indicates neither legitimacy nor prudence. This strike, and the death of Saif al-Arab, have produced little military result at the greatest diplomatic and symbolic cost to Nato.Saif al-Arab was, unlike his brothers, not a senior military commander or propagandist. His death is redolent of the 1986 US strike on the same compound.That raid killed a girl who Col Gaddafi later claimed was his adopted daughter and, in the scarred buildings and craters, furnished him with a long-lasting symbol of defiance.The propaganda value of such unintended deaths is potentially severe.In the 1991 Gulf War, a US stealth bomber directed two bombs at what was claimed to be a command-and-control bunker, but was in fact an Iraqi civilian shelter.The result was 315 deaths, including 130 children. Col Gaddafi, like Saddam Hussein before him, will take every opportunity to exploit such errors to paint Western powers as indiscriminate aggressors.Moreover, this is no longer a conventional war in which top-down direction is crucial. Pro-Gaddafi forces in both the besieged western city of Misrata and in the east have adapted to Nato\\'s air power and are using increasingly unorthodox tactics.They need not rely on a stream of detailed orders from Tripoli, and can cause considerable harm to civilians without this guidance.Nato is understandably frustrated at the diminishing returns of air strikes, since it has destroyed most accessible targets. But killing commanders and disrupting communications is far less important than the key task of degrading heavy military equipment, such as tanks and artillery.If the strike had killed Col Gaddafi himself, would it then have been at least a military success?One of the greatest mistakes of the Iraq war was assuming that, with the departure of Saddam Hussein, the state apparatus could simply be transferred to new ownership.Col Gaddafi\\'s death could see Saif al-Islam Gaddafi take the reins, galvanise supporters, and continue the war with equal intensity. It would be dangerous and short-sighted to portray even effective assassination as a silver bullet.Perhaps, though, the demonstration to the regime that no safe haven exists, and that only capitulation would bring security, justified these risks?There is no doubt that, along with the military aim of disrupting command-and-control hubs, Nato sought a psychological effect, conscious of the possibility of \"accidental assassination\".The problem is that the direction of this effect is unclear. The dramatic visual impact of this air strike, and the death of those disconnected from political and military leadership, will harden the diplomatic opposition to the war, from Russia and China amongst others.More consequentially, it will anger the alliance\\'s warier members, like Germany and Turkey, and inflame parts of Arab and African public opinion.It may eventually leave Britain and France bearing the military burden alone, with modest but limited assistance from a cagey US administration eager to keep at arm\\'s length from this European war.Col Gaddafi\\'s overarching strategy has never been to win a conventional war, but to induce symbolically prominent casualties, drive a wedge between more committed and more ambivalent members of the coalition, and knock away the pillars of political support on which this intervention was built.Thus far, the coalition had sought, rightly, to purchase coalition longevity at the price of campaign intensity. If that balance continues to shift towards the latter, Nato runs the risk of playing into the regime\\'s hands.Shashank Joshi is an Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a defence think-tank in London, and a doctoral student of international relations at Harvard University.\\n', 'Islamic tradition requires the dead to be buried as soon as possible, unless an autopsy is required.The US military took this requirement very seriously, burying the body within hours.\"Traditional procedures for Islamic burial were followed,\" an official said.Religious rites were carried out on the deck of a US aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson. The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea.This occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head.After this first shot, reports ABC News\\' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead.â€¬The body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden\\'s identity was confirmed. Officials say a DNA sample was taken that matched that of several other family members. Some sources say facial recognition technology was also used.From Afghanistan, the body was, it appears, flown to the USS Carl Vinson.\"A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker,\" a US defence official said.According to UK-based Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid, Chairman of the Muslim Council for Religious & Racial Harmony, four key steps need to be followed:There is no necessity for an imam to be present, he says, but the procedures should be carried out by Muslims at least one of whom \"knows the minimum basic Muslim law of burial\".Whether any such person was present is impossible to know, he says, based on the limited information provided. But he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case.It is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey, he says, but in this case there was no sound reason for it.The US authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive Bin Laden family, or even one of the many supporters of his \"evil\" ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial, he argues.His words were echoed by Mohammed Qudah, a professor of Islamic law at the University of Jordan, who told the Associated Press news agency that burying Bin Laden at sea was not forbidden if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial.But he went on: \"It\\'s neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive Bin Laden\\'s body.\"The agency also quoted Dubai\\'s grand mufti Mohammed al-Qubaisi, saying that sea burials were permissible only in extraordinary circumstances, adding: \"This is not one of them.\"\"If the family does not want him, it\\'s really simple in Islam: You dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that\\'s it,\" he said.US officials have given two reasons why a sea burial was chosen. First, that they did not want his grave to become a shrine. Second, that there was no time to negotiate with other countries to arrange a possible burial on land.According to CBS News, Saudi Arabia refused to take the body. If correct, this suggests that an offer was made - and that had Saudi Arabia accepted the body, there would have been a grave, which could in theory have become a shrine.However, ABC\\'s Jonathan Karl, writing before the burial was confirmed, painted a different picture:\"US officials tell me the last thing they want is for his burial place to become a terrorist shrine.\"To avoid that, an informed source tells me, the intention is to bury his body at sea - leaving no definitive location for the final resting place of his body.\"\\n', 'An ISI official told the BBC the compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden was killed by US forces on Sunday had been raided several years ago.But the compound \"was not on our radar\" since then, the official said.The government of Pakistan has categorically denied any knowledge of the raid before it took place.No base within Pakistan was used by US forces, the ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.It went on: \"US helicopters entered Pakistani airspace making use of blind spots in the radar coverage due to hilly terrain.\"However, the ministry defended the ISI, saying: \"As far as the target compound is concerned, ISI had been sharing information with CIA and other friendly intelligence agencies since 2009.\"Bin Laden, 54, was the founder and leader of al-Qaeda. He is believed to have ordered the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, as well as a number of other deadly bombings.The ISI official gave new details of the raid, saying Bin Laden\\'s young daughter had said she saw her father shot.He told the BBC\\'s Owen Bennett-Jones in Islamabad that the compound in Abbottabad, just 100km (62 miles) from the capital, was raided when under construction in 2003.It was believed an al-Qaeda operative, Abu Faraj al-Libi, was there.But since then, \"the compound was not on our radar, it is an embarrassment for the ISI\", the official said. \"We\\'re good, but we\\'re not God.\"He added: \"This one failure should not make us look totally incompetent. Look at our track record. For the last 10 years, we have captured Taliban and al-Qaeda in their hundreds - more than any other countries put together.\"The compound is about a kilometre from the Pakistan Military Academy - the country\\'s equivalent of West Point or Sandhurst.The ISI official also gave new or differing accounts of some of the events of Sunday\\'s raid. They included:The official said it was thought the Americans wanted to take away the surviving women and children but had to abandon the plan when one of the helicopters malfunctioned.By Owen Bennett-JonesBBC News, IslamabadClearly there were people helping Bin Laden in this location... were they state employees, were they simply from Taliban-related groups, were they from the intelligence agencies?For all Americans may ask the questions, I doubt they will get any answers. There will be ambiguity about this and the Pakistanis will deny they had any knowledge whatsoever.The establishment here is made up of army leadership, intelligence agency leadership and some senior civil servants, and they have always run Pakistan, whether democratic governments or military governments, and those people do have connections with jihadis.The difficulty the West has is in appreciating there are more than 20 different types of jihadi organisations, and al-Qaeda is just one of them. The state has different policies towards different types of group and that subtlety is often lost on Western policy-makers.The helicopter was destroyed by the special forces unit.The US has not commented on anyone it captured or had planned to capture, other than saying it had taken Bin Laden\\'s body.The ISI official said the organisation had recovered some documents from the compound.The CIA is already said to be going through a large number of hard drives and storage devices seized in the raid.The White House has not disclosed whether anyone has claimed the $25m (Â£15m) reward for leading the US to Bin Laden.White House counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan said there had been concern Pakistani forces would deploy to counter the US Navy Seal team conducting the raid but it had avoided any confrontation.The ISI official said: \"We were totally caught by surprise. They were in and out before we could react.\"Our correspondent says residents near the compound in Abbottabad reported that Pakistani soldiers had asked them to switch off their lights an hour before the attack, but the ISI official said this was not true and that it had no advance knowledge of the raid.Earlier, in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, President Asif Ali Zardari admitted Bin Laden \"was not anywhere we had anticipated he would be\".But he denied the killing suggested Pakistan was failing in its efforts to tackle terrorism.Mr Zardari said Pakistan had \"never been and never will be the hotbed of fanaticism that is often described by the media\".\"Such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news, but it doesn\\'t reflect fact,\" he said.\"Pakistan had as much reason to despise al-Qaeda as any nation. The war on terrorism is as much Pakistan\\'s war as it is America\\'s.\"Mr Brennan had said it was \"inconceivable that Bin Laden did not have a support system\" in Pakistan. He estimated Bin Laden had been living in the compound in Abbottabad for five or six years.Pakistani Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir tried to draw a line under the matter, saying: \"Who did what is beside the point... This issue of Osama Bin Laden is history.\"Bin Laden was America\\'s most wanted man but had eluded capture for more than a decade.US officials say that after DNA tests they are \"99.9%\" sure that the man they shot and killed and later buried at sea was Bin Laden.US President Barack Obama watched the entire operation in real time in the White House with his national security team.Mr Brennan said: \"The minutes passed like days.\"CIA director Leon Panetta narrated via a video screen from a separate Washington office, with Bin Laden given the code name Geronimo.Mr Panetta\\'s narration lasted several minutes. \"They\\'ve reached the target... We have a visual on Geronimo... Geronimo EKIA (enemy killed in action).\"Mr Obama said: \"We got him.\"Bin Laden, his son Khalid, trusted personal courier Sheikh Abu Ahmed and the courier\\'s brother were all killed, along with an unidentified woman.Bin Laden was shot above his left eye, blowing away a section of his skull, and was also shot in the chest.The BBC\\'s Andrew North in Washington says the White House is still discussing whether to release a video that was made of Bin Laden\\'s burial from an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, which some Islamic scholars have said did not conform with tradition.Our correspondent says many people will want proof that Bin Laden is dead but the White House will be concerned about the reaction if the video, and still photographs of the body, are released.\\n', \"Alassane Ouattara has been in power since his predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo, was forcibly removed from after refusing to recognise Mr Ouattara internationally recognised victory in the November 2010 presidential election.The poll was meant to draw a line under a 2002-03 civil war which left the country split in two, but it led to a stalemate lasting more than four months.Mr Gbagbo, who had been in power for 10 years and several times delayed elections, claimed victory in the 2010 poll and held onto power, helped by his militia but isolated by the international community.Mr Ouattara was initially confined to a hotel near the presidential palace, protected by UN peacekeeping troops.Eventually his militia overran the country and - together with French troops - stormed the presidential palace and captured Mr Gbagbo in April 2011.Mr Gbagbo was subsequently transferred to The Hague to stand trial at the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity.In 2015, Mr Ouattara won a second five-year term with nearly 84% of the vote, in an election described as credible by US observers. An ally of Mr Ggagbo won 9%.A US-educated economist from the Muslim north, Mr Ouattara served as President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's last prime minister after a long career at the International Monetary Fund.After losing a power struggle against Henri Konan Bedie, who became president, Mr Ouattara returned to the IMF, eventually becoming deputy managing director.He made a comeback in Ivorian politics as head of the liberal Rally of the Republicans, which has strong support in the north, and backed the coup that ousted President Bedie in 1999.Disputes about whether Mr Ouattara's parents were Ivorian led to his being debarred from standing for the presidency in 2000 - one of the controversies that prompted the 2002 civil war. As part of the post-war settlement, Mr Ouattara was allowed to register for the 2010 election.\\n\", 'The 71-year-old\\'s show was \"perfectly pleasant\", said The Times\\' reviewer, but was \"not

recorded the acreage of several of the most serious of the 73 heath and grass fires its crews have tackled.The 332-acre total includes 100 acres burnt in Locaber on 1 May, but does not take into account all land affected.Landowners contributed more than Â£1m towards the cost of the fire fighting.The Scottish Rural Property and Business Association (SRPBA), which has provided the figure, said private landowners and estates supplied staff, specialist equipment and paid for helicopters to water-bomb flames.Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service (HIFRS) said the majority of wild fires in its area were now out.Parts of Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Fife were also affected during a dry and windy spell of weather.Crews tackled flames on the Balmoral Estate in Aberdeenshire, while smoke from a fire near Tyndrum temporarily closed the A82 in Argyll.The north-west Highlands was the worst hit.Since the start of the month, 150 acres of burning heath were tackled by crews from Fort William, Newtonmore and Kilchoan.Acharacle and Mallaig dealt with a 100-acre heath fire, while crews from Stornoway and South Lochs extinguished a 24-acre grass fire on Lewis.Dunvegan, Portree and Uig crews extinguished a wild fire that burnt 40 acres on Skye.Hampden Park in Glasgow, Scotland\\'s national stadium, sits in 33 acres bought in 1903.HIFRS has praised firefighters and the public for

is head of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.Two brothers believed to be mid-ranking al-Qaeda officials died in a drone strike in south Yemen on Thursday, Yemeni officials said.The attack came just days after al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US Navy Seals.The Pentagon refused to comment on the reports that Anwar al-Awlaki was specifically targeted in Yemen.According to Yemen\\'s defence ministry, the missile fired by the drone hit a car in in the province of Shabwa carrying two brothers, identified by Yemeni officials as Musa\\'id and Abdullah Mubarak.But reports from Washington now suggest US commanders had believed they had one of al-Qaeda\\'s most valuable targets in their sights.\"We were hoping it was him,\" one unnamed US official told CBS News.The reported attempt to kill Mr Awlaki is believed to be the first known US military strike within Yemen since May 2010, when missiles mistakenly killed one of Mr Saleh\\'s envoys.In September the country\\'s foreign minister said that such unmanned strikes had been suspended.The report comes as Yemenis continue to take to the streets to demand that Ali Abdullah Saleh, president for 30 years, step down.According to the Wall Street Journal, there were several attempts to target Mr Awlaki on Thursday.He escaped an initial attack of three rockets fired at a vehicle in which he was travelling and then swapped cars with the two brothers, who were killed in a second strike by a single drone, the newspaper said.Washington considers the Yemen-based al-Qaeda branch the world\\'s most active terror cell.It is estimated to have some 300 fighters within Yemeni strongholds, clustered around mountain ranges where the central government has little reach.The group is said to have inspired attacks by Muslims within the US as well as plots to smuggle explosives on planes heading to the US.Some analysts are convinced that, after the death of Bin Laden, Mr Awlaki represents the greatest threat.An American-born cleric of Yemeni descent, he was placed on a terrorism blacklist in July 2010 and had imposed financial sanctions on him.US officials say Mr Awlaki helped recruit Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian accused of attempting to blow up an airliner as it flew into Detroit on 25 December 2009.Maj Nidal Hasan, the US Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 comrades in the Fort Hood shooting in 2009, sought religious advice from Mr Awlaki and saw him preach in the US state of Virginia in 2001, US officials say.A student found guilty of attempting to murder British MP Stephen Timms in London was also said to have been inspired by Mr Awlaki\\'s online sermons.\\n', 'Thousands more had official guest status and got a slightly closer view from inside the spaceport itself. A magnificent morning ascent for the youngest of the Nasa spaceplanes as it began its final mission - the delivery of the $2bn Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) instrument to the International Space Station.There will, however, be a group of British engineers for whom Monday\\'s lift-off was a bitter-sweet moment. These are the people whose technology got dropped from AMS in the year before launch.For those not familiar with this story, let me back up and reprise events. They have some potentially fascinating implications for deep space travel.AMS is one of the most expensive science experiments ever put in space - probably the most expensive.It has taken a group of 600 or so researchers from 16 nations a total of 17 years to prepare it for flight. It promises some dramatic new insights into the origin and make-up of the cosmos.AMS will do this by studying the storm of high-energy particles (cosmic rays) that are hurled at Earth from the deepest reaches of the Universe.Critical to its operation is a very strong magnet. As the particles enter AMS, they will bend through this magnet. How they bend reveals their charge, a fundamental property that says a great deal about the nature of those particles and where they came from.The UK at a programmatic level never got involved in AMS, presumably because it was a space station project (and the UK doesn\\'t engage with human spaceflight), but one British company was contracted to build the all-important magnet.Scientific Magnetics (formerly Space Cryomagnetics) of Culham, in Oxfordshire, spent 12 years developing this super-cooled beast, and it was - so the project leaders on AMS told me - a marvel.It was incredibly powerful and directed its entire field inwards, like an enclosed bubble. From the outside, the magnet appeared as an inert beer can.This was really important because if you put such a device on a shuttle or a space station and it hasn\\'t been carefully designed, it will start to interact with its surrounding - even try to orientate itself with the Earth\\'s magnetic field. Not what you want on a space vehicle.But to cut a long story short, the British magnet\\'s super-fluid-helium cooling mechanism meant that it was only ever going to be a short-lived device. And when the space station\\'s life was extended last year to 2020, the AMS project leaders took the decision to remove the UK magnet and replace it with a less powerful, but much longer-lived, Chinese one.Now, as I say, this is a story with some interesting outcomes.The British magnet is currently sitting in store at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern) where AMS was assembled and tested, and there\\'s a lot of interest in seeing its technology put to other uses.The first of these is astronaut protection. The cosmic rays that AMS is trying to characterise are particles that also represent a hazard to humans in space.When astronauts eventually go beyond the space station - back to the Moon, and on to asteroids and Mars - they will need to shield themselves from these high-energy particles. The idea of using a powerful magnetic field to do this job is being investigated Dr Roberto Battiston, the deputy principal investigator on AMS. He told me:\"We continue to work to understand how this technology could be used for future shielding of astronauts undergoing long exposure, for instance at a Moonbase or on a trip to Marsâ€¦ because this is by far the most advanced super-conducting magnet-design ever built and completed for a space mission. It is not going to fly but it had everything that would allow it to fly.\"The European Space Agency asked me to submit a proposal for a feasibility study and [Scientific Magnetics] is part of it.\"We would design the magnet in a different way to the AMS one.  AMS was designed to have a very strong magnetic field within an inner bore. By modifying the coils and the currents, we can design a magnetic field confined in an external ring surrounding an inner bore that is magnetic-field free. In this internal module will be the habitable part for the astronauts - where they will live. We are talking about something having a diameter of about five to six metres and the length of 10m - surrounded by this magnetic field that is intense enough to bend away cosmic rays coming from deep space.\"There are immense practicalities to overcome, of course. These special magnets get their strength because they are superconducting. This means running them at cryo-temperatures, which demands a lot of liquid helium.This has a tendency to boil off over time, limiting the life of your device, which brings us back to AMS. All that said, Professor Battiston is encouraged by the research. He says it should be possible to limit radiation exposure on a Mars flight to something similar to that currently experienced by astronauts on a six-month stay at the space station.The other big space application for which British magnet technology might be useful is in the plasma rockets that could one day propel all spacecraft.These rely on the motion of highly excited gases, or plasmas, moulded by magnetic fields to provide thrust. Although they don\\'t give the initial big kick you get from chemical combustion, their supreme efficiency means they can go on thrusting for extended periods, achieving far more acceleration per kilogram of fuel consumed. Proponents of plasma rockets say they could dramatically cut the journey time to Mars from months to weeks.Scientific Magnetics has already produced a superconducting magnet for a testbed at Ad Astra in Texas, the company at the forefront of this propulsion technology.Steve Harrison from Scientific Magnetics told me:\"These rockets use radio frequency heating to generate the plasma and then the magnets contain the plasma in the same way they do in a tokomak fusion reactor. The magnets are profiled such that they form a sort of nozzle out the back; and because the plasma is expanding and supersonic, it flies out and gives you thrust. For the system Ad Astra has been testing for the last two years, we designed and built the super-conducting magnet.\"Similar obstacles to the magnetic shield prevent immediate adoption of the propulsion application as well, especially if the propulsion magnets incorporate cryogenic liquids, but both concepts are definitely worth watching for the future.\\n', 'The dramatic creation by Philip Treacy has been likened to a Turkey Twizzler, a lavatory seat and a pretzel.The 22-year-old princess wore it to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton last month, and a Facebook page was set up in its honour.The auction on eBay ended on Sunday, with the proceeds going to charities Unicef and Children in Crisis.The identity of the winning bidder has not yet been revealed.The princess commented on the auction page: \"I\\'ve been amazed by the amount of attention the hat has attracted.\"It\\'s a wonderful opportunity to raise as much money as possible for two fantastic charities.\"I hope whoever wins the auction has as much fun with the hat as I have.\"\\n']\n",
